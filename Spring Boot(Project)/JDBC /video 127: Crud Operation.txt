So, we were able to get the data right 
1st we fetch the single data we are not
sure how many data's we have  and we have 3 columns
which u going to fetch now of course u automate

But what about Inserting the data is it realy possible of course
right when u are connecting your application with database and the
user may want to add so many recourds.

So, there is something called CRUD operation which is 
    Create    Read      Update      Delete
so, we were able to read so, the our part is done but what about 
the Create Read and Delete.
What will remain common is the Establishment in connection
because after that things will start changing so, u need the
current statement as well.
                  'Statement st = con.createStatement()'
Things will change from here so, what ever we do is we change the part from here
because that something we want to change
