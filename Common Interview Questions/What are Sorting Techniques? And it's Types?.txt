Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format - either ascending
or descending order. In java, sorting helps in optimizing search
operations, reporting and organizing data efficiently.

  Types of Sorting Techniques
  ---------------------------
Sorting can be broadly categorized into:
1. Internal Sorting
        Performed when the data fits entirely into memory.
        Fast and efficient for small to medium-sized datasets.
2. External Sorting
        Used when data is too large to fit into memory.
        Involves assessing disk based data.

  Common Internal Sorting Algorithms
  ----------------------------------
1. Bubble Sort
   -----------
   Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity:
                O(n^2)
