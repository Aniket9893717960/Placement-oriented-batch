we have to fetch the data but not with the help of 'ram' with the help of
something else 'brand' and from the 'brand' value of course we have to use 
single couts now because that's the string and of course u can use 'Like' 
as well.
For String or text it make sense to use 'Like' here i have to specify the brand
name as 'Asus' ok and we fetch this.
  This is the done code.
  Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like 'Asus'");
  List<laptop> = query.getResultList();

But what if u have this data in the string variable and u have storing that
data here 'Asus'. Now u have to pass this external data in this query.

Now if u are comming from the JDBC we will call the prepare statement.
In which u will pass the question mark u can done the same thing here 
u can put the question mark.
But the only difference is u have to also maintoined the no.
'q1','q2' so when u have the bigger query with multiple fields 
u want to insert and if you have multiple question mark some time

It's confusing to u as well that which question mark u are targeting and which
can lead
