So, we talked about how can we create a web application using Java.
So, basically we can use servlets to build our web application.
So, when i say web app what i'm talking about is this should be a
back end which can accept the request and reply something to the client.

And then process the request and reply something to the client. And of course
in java we don't build the front end, right. The  front end is built using 
HTML, CSS, Javascript. Or you can use something called react to build your 
front end.

Or u can also use a mobile application. or may be some other server using 
your server to get some data. Ultimately, your server is basically giving 
some data back to the client

Ultimately, your server is basically giving some data back to the client.
Now the thing is, if we talk about building a web application, of course 
we have done that with the help of servlet.

now think about it what if u want to return a data. It's very simple You can
say "hey servlet I need to get some data from the database."
So, servlet will talk to database and get your data back and say okay this
is your data. Take it back.

Now if u just want to return data it's very simple.But then we know that if
you want your client to see some data on a browser, u cannot simply send
a data right.

That's boring.
