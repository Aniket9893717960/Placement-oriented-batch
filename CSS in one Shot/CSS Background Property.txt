              CSS Background Property
              -----------------------
With Css, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"

a HEX value - like "#ffG000"

an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

i. Width : The width CSS property sets an element's width.
   ------- By default, it sets the width of the content area
The specified value of width applies to the content area so long
as its value remains within the values defined by min-width and max-width.

a. If the value for width is less than the value for min-width, 
then min-width overrides width.

b. If the value for width is greater than the value for max-width, 
then max-width overrides width.

ii. Height : The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. 
    ------   By default, the property defines the height of the content area.

                      # Key Differences Between Height and Weight
                      -------------------------------------------

Dimension: width controls the horizontal dimension, 
---------- while height controls the vertical dimension of an element.

Behavior with Content: If the content inside an element exceeds the 
----------------------specified width or height, it may overflow, 
depending on the overflow property settings.

Responsiveness: Both properties can be set in relative units (like %),
--------------- making them adaptable to different screen sizes and resolutions.


iii. Background-color : This property is used to set 
     ----------------   the beckground color of an element.

iv. Background Image : Property is used to set the
    -----------------  background image of an element.

v. universal Selector :The universal selector is a special type selector
   ------------------  and can therefore be namespaced when using @namespace.
This is useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces 
such as HTML with inline SVG or MathML, or XML that mixes multiple vocabularies.

vi. margin : The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin
    --------  area on all four sides of an element.

The margin property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values.
Each value is a <length>, a <percentage>, or the keyword auto.
Negative values draw the element closer to its neighbors than 
it would be by default.

a) When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides.

b) When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom,
the second to the left and right.

c) When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top,
the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.

d) When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right,
bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).

vii. Padding : The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding 
     --------- area on all four sides of an element at once.

The padding property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values. 
Each value is a <length> or a <percentage>. Negative values are invalid.

a) When one value is specified, it applies the same padding to all four sides.

b) When two values are specified, the first padding applies to 
the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.

c) When three values are specified, the first padding applies
to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.

d) When four values are specified, the paddings apply to the 
top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).
