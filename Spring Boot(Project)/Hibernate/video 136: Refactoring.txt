So, let's optimize this code and remove some of unusall lines here
So, let's start the first one in 'Main.java' file is 'save' method.
And u see this will giving u some lines.

If something want wrong we have to change it. There is no compiler
time issue but let's understand what is happening So,

it's say that the 'save' method is deprecated since version 6.0.
If u are using 6.0 and above 'save' is deprecated And they have 
done it because to match it with JPA.

So, basically as i maintoined before all the tools try to match the
Protocols/Standard with JPA And JPA will use different names and 
conventions.
             So, 'Persist' is the word instead of using save because at 
the code of 'save' method "@Deprecated" is already used.

              session.persist(s1);

But we also have the Problem with 'SessionFactory' line in same program.
with the method "buildSessionFactory" because if we click on this method 
it will give 'Warning' name ""
