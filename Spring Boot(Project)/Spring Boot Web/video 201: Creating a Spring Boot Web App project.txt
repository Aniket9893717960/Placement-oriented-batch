Now let's see how do we create a web application with the help of Spring?
So, of course we have talk about MVC project with the help of Spring
framework.
  
And the beauty is there are two ways of doing it. One is using normal
Spring framework. And second with the help of Spring Boot. And we know till
this point that if u want to do something with Spring boot, it is much
easier.

And if u wanna do something with Spring framework, u have to done some 
configuration. So, we'll start with Spring boot. Let's understand the 
concept. How do u build a web application using Spring Boot?

And once u understand enough, then we'll see how do we create a same 
project with the help of normal Spring MVC? And u can see the difference
that how much configuration we can save with the help of Spring Boot.

Now question arise, if u want to create a Spring boot project, how will 
u do it?
