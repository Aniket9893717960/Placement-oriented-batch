Now let's solve this problem. In the previous video we solve this with 
'Qualifier' and if we run the program we got error and we talk also
we used primary as well.
Where exactly we are going to use 'primary' So, where exactly we are going 
to use primary let's say we use 'primary' at the top of 'Desktop'.
Just by maintoining primary we will prefer desktop whenever u have the 
confusion.
But what happens when i used 'primary' and 'Qualifier' together.
Then if we run the program we get to know that 
'Qualifier' has more priority then 'primary' doesn't matter what primary
which primary u say if u maintoined 'Qualifier' it will follow that at 
particular one.

That's about 'primary' and 'Qualifier' which will get preference is 
'Qualifier' But if u want to resolve the confusion then u can use 
'primary' there.
