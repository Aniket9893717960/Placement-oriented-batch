This is simple but important past of CSS.
Name is "Box Model CSS".
        --------------
This will have 4 Components are:

i. Content : the content of the box, where
             text and images appear.

ii. Padding : Clears an area around the content.
              The padding is transparent.
(content or border k bich ki space ko agar ap ko 
increase decrease karana h to 'Padding' ki help
s kiya j sakta h)
This will have four Properties are as follows.
           Padding Property
           ----------------
Allows you to specify how much space should appear
between the content of an element and its 
border.

|-> a. padding-left: property sets the left padding  
|      ------------- (space) of an element(unit is px).
|
|-> b. padding-top: property sets the top padding 
|      ------------  (space) of an element.
|
|-> c. padding-right
|-> d. padding-bottom
------|
Now we talk about it's short Properties are:
we just simply write padding and intitalize it
only one value then:-
a. 'padding: 5px' where '5px' is common for all
   -------------- four direction.

b.'padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px' 
   -------   |   |   |   |
          _____ ___ ___ ________
           |     |   |        |
          Top  Right Bottom  Left



iii. border : A border that goes around the 
              Padding and content.

iv. Margin : clears an area outside the border.
             The margin is transparent.
(Agar ap ko boder k outside ki space ko increase or decrease
 And make difference in distance between 2 content
 karana h to 'Margin' ki help s kiya j sakta h)
           Margin Property
           ---------------

                                  # Scrollbars
                                  ------------
*visible - Allows the content to overflow the borders
           of its containing element.

*Hidden -  The content of the nested element is simply 
           cut off at the border of the containing element
           and no scrollbars is visible.
    TO understand Hidden u need to understand about 'overflow'.
  
Overflow : property specifies whether to clip the content or to add
            scrollbars when the content of an element
is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. 
           The content renders outside the element's box.
          (Doesn't don anything)

hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the 
           rest of the content will be invisible
         (It doesn't give any scroll bar to see the unvisible part)

scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar
           is added to see the rest of the content
         (It gives both Horizontal and vertical Scroll bar)

auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds
           scrollbars only when necessary
       (It gives the by default scroll bar But Gives only
        Vertical scroll bar)

Example :  
      div {
        background-color: coral;
        width: 200px;
        height: 65px;
        border: 1px solid;
        overflow: visible;
      }

*Scroll - The size of the containing element does not change,
          but the scrollbars are added to allow the user 
          to scroll to see the content.

*Auto - The purpose is the same as scroll, but the scrollbar
        will be shown only if the content does overflow.
