So, Now we have the data in database. The next thing we gonna do is
'fatch the data'. Now if you go back to your code.
U can see what we are doing in 'Main.java' file is we were adding 
the data in the student and we are trying to save it.

We don't want to save it we want to fatch it and to do that 
what we do is first of all i want to create an object of 'Student'.

           Student s2 = new Student();
But we want to keep it                  "Student s2 = null"
at this point And instead of printing 's1' we print 's2'.
And we just commit the 'session.persist()' part.
                        -----------------  If u see it printing 'null'.

Because we are just assinging the 'null' in 's2' and we are printing 'null' 
In between this two Operations we want to fatch the value.

So, before we moving on first we have to know that is there any requirment 
of 'Transaction'.
