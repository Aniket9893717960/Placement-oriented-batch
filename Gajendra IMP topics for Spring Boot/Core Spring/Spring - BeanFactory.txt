The first and foremost thing when we ralk about Spring is dependency
injection which is possible because Spring is a container and behaves as a
factory of Beans. Just like the BeanFactory interface is the simplest
container providing an advanced configuration mechanism to instantiate,
configure and manage the life cycle of beans.

Beans are Java objects that are configured at run time by Spring loC
Container. BeanFactory represents a basic loC container which is a parent 
interface of ApplicationContext.
BeanFactory uses Beans and their dependencies metadata to create and 
configure them at run time.

BeanFactory loads the bean definitions and dependency amongst the beans 
based on a configuration file (XML) or the beans can be directly returned
when required using Java Configuration.
