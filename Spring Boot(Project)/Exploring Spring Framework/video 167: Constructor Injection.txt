Now u just talk about "Constructor Injection".
In java if u want to create the object or if u want to initialize the values
we can do that in constructor as well.
And most of the time we do that if u want to create the object or if u want 
to want to initialize the value.

we can do that in constructor as well And most of the time we do that
most of the time when we assign the value and the object is created
we prefer to use constructor.

setter's are good but when u want to assign the values latter setter make 
sense But if u want to assign the value as u can create the object u can
use constructor.

Ok so, how do i do that for example let's say we do have the constructor here
which is the default constructor. But let's say if i have the parameterized
constructor.
  public Alien(int age){
     this.age = age;
  }

  SO, this is i want to assign the value. I don't want to use the property
Tag now so, when i use property tag so, basically it uses the setter but
i don't want to do that i want to use the constructor.
Now how u want to assign the value with the help of constructor.
  The way u cando it is with the help of "<constructor-arg />"
And here u can assign the value directly we can say 'value' is '21'
  Now the differece between the previous one and this one is before
we using property and here we use 'constructor-arg'.

If u want to even prove that
