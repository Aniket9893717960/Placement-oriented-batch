So, let's optimize this code and remove some of unusall lines here
So, let's start the first one in 'Main.java' file is 'save' method.
And u see this will giving u some lines.

If something want wrong we have to change it. There is no compiler
time issue but let's understand what is happening So,

it's say that the 'save' method is deprecated since version 6.0.
If u are using 6.0 and above 'save' is deprecated And they have 
done it because to match it with JPA.

So, basically as i maintoined before all the tools try to match the
Protocols/Standard with JPA And JPA will use different names and 
conventions.
             So, 'Persist' is the word instead of using save because at 
the code of 'save' method "@Deprecated" is already used.

              session.persist(s1);

But we also have the Problem with 'SessionFactory' line in same program.
with the method "buildSessionFactory" because if we click on this method 
it will give 'Warning' 
              name "Session Factory used without 'try' -with- resources statement".
So, the thing is 'SessionFactory' is a very heavy wait object basically it consume 
some resources And since we are not closing any where.
It says why not use try with resource. Because try u want to create the resource
in the block or when u exit the block 'resource' will automatically close So,
we have that option so, u basically come back Here
                        And close the session and close the 'SessionFactory'.
i. U either use try with resources or u can close the session and 'SessionFactory'.
   Manually after complete the work.


So, what about u create of 
               Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
               cfg.addAnnotatedClass(Student.class);
                      cfg.configure();
                                 3 lines why u need this 3 lines look at this
we are using that line only once For this only purpose u are using 3 lines Not
recormended So, what u will do is we are using 'cfg' object at 
'SessionFactory' line.

If i will merge every thing in one line So, we will commit 
"cfg.buildSessionFactory()" and replace it with.
"new Configuration().addAnnotatedClass(com.telusko.Student.class).configure()
 .buildSessionFactory()"
So, what we are doing is we are writing every thing in one line now
and if u want to look it better Below format even this look Good.

SessionFactory sf = new Configuration()
                   .addAnnotatedClass(com.telusko.Student.class)
                   .configure()
                   .buildSessionFactory();

We know that this is also a 3 line but no. of statement will become one.
