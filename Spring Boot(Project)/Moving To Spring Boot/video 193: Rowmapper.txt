So, now let's fetch the data which you are storing Now basically to do that
we have to add the code in the findAll.So, basically this is not what we 
want now SO, we replace 'findAll' old data with new.
OLD CODE in 'StudentRepo':
  public List<Student> findAll(){
    List <Student> student = new ArrayList<>();
    return student;
  }
New CODE Now we construct after remove it SO, basically when u use a query So,
first of all, let's use a query.
  Sting sql = "Select * from student";
               Now how do you fetch all data from database or from the 
table. You say "Select * from student". And now i went to execute this
query. So, whenever you use a select query in JDBC. we have to execute
a method called execute query.

But here, if you say jdbc, we don't have execute query, but we have a 
query. Now query takes two parameters. 
  first the actual query, which is sql in this case,
  second build the object of "Rowmapper".

So, if u go to the query u have allot of options in which u have to choose
the first one is string, the sql.Second one is 'Rowmapper', basically you 
can fetch data from you result set.
If u remember in JDBC, whenever you file a query, a select query,u get a 
'ResultSet'.In this result set you have all your data. Now from this 
resultSet, you get one by one data and 'RowMapper will help you to fetch 
  that data' from the Result Set.

So, let's use the 'RowMapper' so, what exactly is 'RowMapper'.IN this u
have to specify the type of 'student' because that's what you're working 
with and let's say this is mapper = new.

Okay. the thing is, is it a class or the interfaces
