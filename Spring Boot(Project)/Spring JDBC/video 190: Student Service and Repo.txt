Now here we create 'StudentService' then u have to make sure that this class
will belongs to different package let's say 'Service' package then we have to 
also create that package.
So, u can see we got the service package and now in that, we have a file
called 'StudentService'. Basically in this i want a method which says
'addStudent'.So, when we talk about this program method.

They should belongs to that particular class And for that, what i will do is
i will create the object for 'StudentService' in "SpringJdbcExApplication".
Now instead of creating the object by overselves we should be asking the 
context to give you the Bean for 'StudentService.class'.

But this will not work because on 'StudentService', we are not using a
annotation. So, which one we should use? so, of course we should use
"@Component" but here i want to use '@Service' because this is a 
'Service' class.

Now if u go back to "@SpringJdbcExApplication" we simply say 
"service.addStudent" but unfortunately we don't have this method in the 
'service' class.
See in the service class we have multiple methods Not just for storing 
data in database because the actual code for data in database will be
done in 'repository'.

Apart from those methods for 'declutter' we have some more methods as 
well.If u want to say :
"Find a student who got a marks more than this or that or any processing
you want to do on students."
