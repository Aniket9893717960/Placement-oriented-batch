Now what we will do is when we see the 'Laptop' class because 'Alien'
is dependent on 'Laptop'.
As i maintoin before when u want to build a product or code u need a 
'Laptop'.But technically when u think doesn't need only a 'Laptop'.
U can also work with 'Desktop' as well.

If u want to build the code then 'Laptop' is not required even desktop
works Most of the company will give u 'Desktop' as well.
"But in the code we just saying that 'Alien' is only dependent on
'laptop' which is wrong".

To make the code correct "We have to make a layeron the top of 'Alien'
Something like a computer" Everyone has the computer but we don't write
computer as object.
Computer is just a concept the implementation of that is Desktop,
laptop, mobile phone and everything.

So, what i will do is for this 'Laptop' class.We can create an 
interface
