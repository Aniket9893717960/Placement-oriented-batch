              1. Why Do We Need Control Flow?
 Imagine following instructions in real life:
 *If it's raining, take an umbrella.
 *"For every apple in the basket,eat one."
  These are decisions and repeated actions. Programs need this too, so they
  can act smartly-choosing what to do and repeating tasks when needed.
Dart,like other modern language, has decision-making statements and loops.
The Dart team included these basics so programmers feel at home and can 
structure their logic simply and readably.

         2. Decision Making with if,else if, and else
These statements let a program choose different actions based on true/false
tests. Example: CODE:
  int temp=35;
  if(temp>30){ print('It\'s hot!');}
  else if(temp>20){ print('It\'s warm.'); }
  else { print('It\'s cool.'); }

 ii. why: This helps your app respond differently to user input, sensor
          data or anything that can change.

 iii. Why Did Dart Get This Feature? Decision making is the foundation
                                     of interactive and useful programs.
      Dart uses the familiar C-style 'if/else' syntax so programmers can
      quickly pick up and read code, whether they are new or experienced.

         3. Looping: Doing things Repeatedly
 3.i. for Loops:
  Used when u know how many times u want to repeat an action. CODE:
      for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){ print('Step $i'); }
 ii. Why? This is great for things like showing a list of items or 
          doing calculation multiple times.
 iii. Why Did Dart Get for Loops this Way?
 The classic 'for' loop format matches other popular languages, making 
 Dart accessible and standard. It's precise and clear for counting based 
 tasks.

 3.ii. While And do while Loops:
  Used while when the number of repetitions depends on charging 
  conditions: CODE:
      int bottles =3;
      while(bottles >0){ print('$bottles bottles left'); 
      bottles--; }
 
   *do while ensures the code runs at least once.
 ii. Why? These types of loops give flexibilty for things like waiting
         for a taks to finish or processing user input of unknown length.
 iii. Why Did Dart Keep These? They allow elegent handling of open ended
        or unpredictable situations, just like in other major languages.

 3.iii. for-in Loops (for-each)
 Want to look at every time in a List? Use 'for-in': CODE:
   var fruits = ['apple','banana','orange'];
      for(var fruit in fruits){ print(fruit); }
 *Why: Much easier and cleaner than counting manually!

 3.iv. Why Did Dart include for-in?
 Modern programs often work with collections. 'for-in' makes code safer,
 more readable and less error prone.

                       4. break and continue
 *break stops a loop early if a condition happens.
 *continue skips to the next round of the loop. CODE:
      for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
      if(i==3) continue; print(i); //prints 1,2,4,5 (skips 3)
      }
      }
