we have to fetch the data but not with the help of 'ram' with the help of
something else 'brand' and from the 'brand' value of course we have to use 
single couts now because that's the string and of course u can use 'Like' 
as well.
For String or text it make sense to use 'Like' here i have to specify the brand
name as 'Asus' ok and we fetch this.
  This is the done code.
  Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like 'Asus'");
  List<laptop> = query.getResultList();
