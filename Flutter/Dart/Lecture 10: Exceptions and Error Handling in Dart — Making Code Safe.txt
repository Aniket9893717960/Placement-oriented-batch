           1. Why Do Error Happen? Why handle Them?
In life, mistakes and surprises are normal maybe u try to open a locked
door or call a friend with the wrong number. Computers run into similar
problems: dividing by zero, accessing missing files or getting bad user
input.
Without proper handling, programs creash or behave strangely. Professional
- quality code doesn't mastakes - it plans for them was designed to help u
handle these "exceptions" smartly, making your app reliable and safe.

                2. What is an Exception?  
An exception is Dart's way of saying, "Oops! Something went Wrong."
Whenever Dart faces a problem it can't solve (like trying to read a 
file doesn't exist), it throws an exception.
  i. Why does Dart use Exceptions?
 Exceptions instantly stop normal operations and allow u-the programmer-
 to react thoughtfully, rather than letting users see errors or crashes.

           3. How Dart throws and Catches Exceptions?
*Throwing an exception is Dart's way to report a problem.
*Catching an exception means preventing the crash and taking action, like
 showing a helpful message or trying something else.
Example: CODE: 
      void main() { try { int result = 10 ~/ 0; } //Division by zero!
