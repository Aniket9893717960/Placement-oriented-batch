Now let's create the 'configuration' now how we can do it.
Do we have a way of 'xml' and 'annotation' Now we will start with 'xml'
and we do certain things with that letter on we see what if we don't want
to use 'xml' how we can do that with annotation.

But Now let's work with 'xml' we know that we have the folder here name
'resources' where u put all the xml files and 'resources'. So, we have
to put something there the movement u write 
        'Configuration cfg = new Configuration();' line.
This know that u have to find the 'Configuration' somewhere and u do that  
with the help of 'cfg.configure()' when u call this method then
this actually loads the 'xml'.
But unfortunatly u don't have the xml let's we see that we got an Error
Let we run this so yes we got an exception name 
       "Could not locate cfg.xml resources (hibernate.cfg.xml)"
                                               |- This is the by Default name.
We have to build different names but u have to put that here if we don't want
to do that then go with different thing.
This resources will create the new file int 'resources' package with name as
'hibernate.cfg.xml' because that's what the console says here
