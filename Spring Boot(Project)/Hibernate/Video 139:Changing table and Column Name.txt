In this video let's try to focus on some annotations which we can use
to customize your table Details.
Ok if u go back here the things which we have in 'Student.java'
will have all those variable like we got 'rollNo','sName'
and 'sAge' we have the name for it and the class name is 
'Student'
And if you look at the database we have the same thing here 
we got the Table name as 'Student' with small 's' but 
what if we want to change it because No buddy in java
will use 'camel cassing'.

So, here in java will go for 'snake cassing'.
whenever u want to go with different name of the columns
and tables.
How will you do that Instead of going 'Student' we were going for 
the new class and we give the name of class as 'Alien'.
