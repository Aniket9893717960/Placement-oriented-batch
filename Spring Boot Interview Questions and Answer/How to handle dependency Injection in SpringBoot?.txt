Spring Boot leverages the Spring framework's inversion of Control(loC)
container to manage dependencies automatically. Here's how it works:

1. Core Mechanisms:
  i) @Autowired Annotation:
    Spring Boot Automatically injects dependencies where needed.
CODE:
    @Service
    public class UserService {
      @Autowired
      private UserRepository userRepo;
    }

  ii) Constructor Injection (Recommended):
  Preferred for immutability and testability. Spring Boot implicitly
  injects dependencies of a class has a single constructor.
CODE:
    @Service
    public class UserService {
      private final UserRepository userRepo;
      public UserService(UserRepository userRepo){
       this.userRepo = userRepo;
      }
    }

  iii) Setter Injection:
 Used for optional Dependencies.
CODE:
    @Service
    public class UserSercice {
     private UserRepository userRepo;
     @Autowired
     public void setUserRepo(UserrRepository userRepo){
       this.userRepo = userRepo;
     }
    }

2. Key Annotations:
   @Component: Generic stereotype for Spring - managed beans.
   @Service, @Repository, @Controller : Specialized annotations for layers
                                        (business, persistence, web).
   @Configuration + @Bean: Programmatically define beans in config classes.
CODE:
 @Configuration
 public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public MyService myService(){
   return new MyService();
  }
 }

3. Dependency Resolution
 Spring Boot scans components in the same package/subpackage as the main
 class(@SpringBootApplication).

 To scan external packages:
CODE:
 @SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = 
                             {"com.example.app","com.example.lib"})

4. Best Practices
* Use Constructor Injection (ensures mandatory dependencies, avoids
 "NullPointerException").
* Avoid "@Autowired" on fields (Makes testing harder).
* Profile - specific beans with "@Profile("dev")" for environment-based
  DI.
* Use "@Qualifier" to resolve conflicts when multiple beans of the same
  type exist.
CODE:
     @Autowired
     @Qualifier("mysqlDataSource")
     private DataSource dataSource;

5. Advanced Custom DI
 * @Primary: Prioritize a bean when multiple candidates exist.
 * @Lazy: Delay bean initialization until first use.
 * @Conditional: Conditioanlly register beans (e.g., based on 
   properties).
