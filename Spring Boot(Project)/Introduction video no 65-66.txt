Q) What is an Editior?


An editor, on the other hand, is a tool used to write and edit code. Examples of editors include:

Text Editors: Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Code Editors with Java Support: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans (these are also considered IDEs)
You can write Java code in any text editor, but you need tools like the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run it.


Q) what is an IDE?


An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides tools for software development, such as writing, editing, debugging, and running code. Examples of Java IDEs include:

Eclipse
IntelliJ IDEA
NetBeans
These IDEs support Java programming and provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools to make development easier.


-----------NOTE------------ *for bigenners using Editors will make sense. But for Development IDE's will be Support this as compare to Editiors -------------------


VS code is a Light weight editior or IDE


we know that in Every 6 month we get some new Version but Not all the Version are LTS(Long Term Support)


*For checking that in the system java Environment variable path set of not will be checked by this command.                         "javac --version"




if u want to build the multiple choice on to the same Entities.


i) Select the datatype of variable and copy past at that no. of time the user want to print the data.


ii) instead of choosing that we work on the new concept which is array


but the problem is why do we build all the things separately.




In the concept of OOPs we have something known about Objects 
Where you can have a class and In the class you have multiple variables.
And you create one object of multiple variables so those object becomes One entity
So, instead of array.
Int id[];
String question[];
String opt1[];
We build a one question class which will hold all the values then create an array of Questions.



public class QuestionService {
    int id;
    String question;
    String opt1;
    String opt2;
    String opt3;
    String opt4;
    String answer;
}



Make sure all the variables are private in the concept of encapsulation we seen it
But the main Question is how we can access it.



To Access this Variables we get help to Getter and Setters



Here 'Getter' are those who get the data. So, getter's  for this code are as follows.



public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public String getQuestion() {
        return question;
    }
    public String getOpt1() {
        return opt1;
    }
    public String getOpt2() {
        return opt2;
    }
    public String getOpt3() {
        return opt3;
    }
    public String getOpt4() {
        return opt4;
    }
    public String getAnswer() {
        return answer;
    }



Go to 'Setter' then this are those who set the data. So, setter's for this code are as follows:



public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void setQuestion(String question) {
        this.question = question;
    }
    public void setOpt1(String opt1) {
        this.opt1 = opt1;
    }
    public void setOpt2(String opt2) {
        this.opt2 = opt2;
    }
    public void setOpt3(String opt3) {
        this.opt3 = opt3;
    }
    public void setOpt4(String opt4) {
        this.opt4 = opt4;
    }
    public void setAnswer(String answer) {
        this.answer = answer;
    }




Now we create a new java file "QuestionService.java" in which we create a "Question" array in this i have specify how much questions i need let's say '5' Question at this point.



like this. "public class QuestionService {
  
    Question[] questions = new Question[5];

}
"
