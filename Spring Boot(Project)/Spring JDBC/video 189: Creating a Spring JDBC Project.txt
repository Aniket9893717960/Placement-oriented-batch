So, let's start our journey of creating a project with "Spring MVC + H2"
First we go to "SPRING INITIALIZER".
i. write the project build tool is 'Maven'. 
ii. Language "Java".
iii. Spring Boot version '3.2.0'
iv. let's say group id is "com.telusko". let's set the 'ArtifactId' as
'SpringJDBCEx'.
v. 'Description' of this project is 
   "Demo project for Spring Boot and JDBC".
vi. 'Packaging' i stick to 'jar'.
vii. 'Version' i choose is '17'. Also suggest that u have to choose the
     lartest LTS version.
viii. Add Dependencies which we have required 
      a. We need Spring JDBC when we search for 'JDBC' we got 'JDBC Api'
         name.
      b. we have to add for Database So, we search for 'H2'.
ix. Then click on generate -> Unzip folder -> Open in intellij idea.

After all this things when we actually open the 'pom.xml' file
Now below is the dependencies which we added in 'SpringJDBCEx'.
CODE:
    <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

Now we need some things like
 i. we need a class which we are going to work with even before that 
    i will make sure that 'SpringjdbcExApplication' will run properly or
    not.
