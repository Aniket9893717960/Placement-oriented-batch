As we have seen that 'Exception' is a super class right and that we have a lot of sub classes
let's we try to understand the Entire Hierarchy not talk about all the class just we
want to give you the general idea.

with the help of this we generalize that which class belongs to where and
which exception are cumpulsory to handle and which are not this are the 
important point you have to remeber

1)  firsty there is a root class name 'Object' Because
Every class in java Extends 'object' if you don't maintion it's there.
Let's give respect to object class.
                          OBJECT

2)  secondly there is a child class which extends 'OBJECT' name 'THROABLE'
let's remeber while searching for the class 'RuntimeException' which
extends 'THROABLE'.
                          OBJECT
                            |
                          THROWABLE

3) In Next we have two classes which Extends 'Throwable' in which
    i) is 'Exceptions' 
    ii) is 'Error'
Here we are not talking about 'Error' only talk about 'Exception' because
we talk about 'run - time exception' that it's something we have to handle
So, 'Exceptions' are something which you can and you should to handle but
'Errors' you can't.
                          OBJECT
                            |
                          THROWABLE
                            |
        --------------------------------------
        |                                     |
      Error                                Exception

'Errors' we have Just like 'ThreadDeath','IoError' and 'Virtual Machine Error' 
which have some inner method errors like 'OutOfMemory' error. 
                          OBJECT
                            |
                          THROWABLE
                            |
        --------------------------------------
        |                                     |
      Error                                Exception
                                                |
                                      --------------------------------------
                                      |               |                     |
                              Runtime Exception    SQL Exception        IO Exception
                               |-> Arithmetic E       |                      |
                               |-> ArrayIndexOutOfBound ---------------------
                               |-> NullPointerException               |
                   This All know as Unchecked Exception    This other called Checked Exception

Here 'Unchecked' Exception's will warned you to handle the Exception or caught at run time But 'Checked'
will force you to handle it and caught at compile time.
Here we not talk about 'throws' yet but we will talk about it
