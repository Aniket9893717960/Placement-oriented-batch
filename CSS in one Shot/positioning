There are many kind of position we have but 
Important positioning are 'Absolute' and 'Relative'

Relative: A relative positioned element is
--------- positioned relative to its normal
          position.

Absolute: An absolute position element is
--------  positioned relative to the first
          parent element that has a position
          other than static.
          
          -------------NOTE------------
*You can use LEFT RIGHT TOP BOTTOM only if you are using
 Positions with Absolute.
 Example:
           position:absolute
           Left: 0;
