Now let's create the 'configuration' now how we can do it.
Do we have a way of 'xml' and 'annotation' Now we will start with 'xml'
and we do certain things with that letter on we see what if we don't want
to use 'xml' how we can do that with annotation.

But Now let's work with 'xml' we know that we have the folder here name
'resources' where u put all the xml files and 'resources'. So, we have
to put something there the movement u write 
        'Configuration cfg = new Configuration();' line.
This know that u have to find the 'Configuration' somewhere and u do that  
with the help of 'cfg.configure()' when u call this method then
this actually loads the 'xml'.
But unfortunatly u don't have the xml let's we see that we got an Error
Let we run this so yes we got an exception name 
       "Could not locate cfg.xml resources (hibernate.cfg.xml)"
                                               |- This is the by Default name.
We have to build different names but u have to put that here if we don't want
to do that then go with different thing.
This resources will create the new file int 'resources' package with name as
'hibernate.cfg.xml' because that's what the console says here.

The first thing u need is 'hibernate configuration' tag and this is coming from this
doc type here and in this u were getting the 'session-factory' tag in this u were 
get by default now in this 'session-factory' tag.
U have to maintoined certain properties so, let's maintoined the first property is:

i. name = "hibernate.connection.driver_class" under the 'property' tag opening
and closing we write "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver".
ii. u have to maintoin the url right with name is:
    name = "hibernate.connection.url" under the 'property' tag opening
and closing we write "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306".
iii. name = "hibernate.connection.username" under the 'property' tag opening
and closing we write "<Given UserName>".
iv. name = "hibernate.connection.password" under the 'property' tag opening
and closing we write "Given Password".

Now if i run the Program then  we got the different error.
          'unable to locate persistent: com.telusko.student' it means that compiler 
will able to load the 'configuration' but i am not able to find the class or persist the class. But u say "hey there is a class here why u are not able to persist because it's a normal class"
Hibernate say of if u want to to map those classes we have to add the 'configuration'
so, u can do that here with the code or u will do that in the 'xml'.

So, we return to 'Main.java' file and write at the next line of 'Configuration' is
'cfg.' after u check that u see multiple methods at which u have to chose one method
So, we chose 'addAnnotatedClass' in which we have to define the url of 'Student' class like this:

        Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
     cfg.addAnnotatedClass(com.telusko.Student.class);
                  cfg.configure();
