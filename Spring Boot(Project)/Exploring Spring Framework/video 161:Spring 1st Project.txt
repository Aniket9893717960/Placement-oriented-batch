              -----------NOTE------------
The moment i will create the project the first file we see the 'pom.xml'
And we have talk about in maven this is the file which helps maven to 
understand what u need So, by default we got only one dependency
Which is "junit 3.8.1" So, that's why when u open the external
libraries u find 'junit' there.
              ------------X--------------
It's time to start with the spring framework.
Before this we have written the code with 'Spring Boot'.
And Now we know how is it to work with spring boot.

The problem is Of course we use all the annotations.
We can ask to manage certain things to manage 'Beans' or
certain object's for us.

But for that we have to use some annotations. we have 'component'
And if u want to connect them we have 'Autowire' we know those 
things.
But if u want to understand what is happening behind the seen
And how things are moving behind the seen First we have to understand 
How spring works.

That we have to write the code in 'spring framework' without spring boot.
And to done that let's create a new project.
So, let's get back to IDE we are using 'Intellij' here.

Now here u can click on file 'New' And let me create a new project
And mind u we can create a maven project Not spring boot.
Because when we go to spring project. We start with "start.spring.io" 
And we got the project structure.

              ------------NOTE----------
We have to select basic 'Archtype' in 'Maven Archtype' as 'quickstart'
Because it create a basic structure and u can import anything u want.
