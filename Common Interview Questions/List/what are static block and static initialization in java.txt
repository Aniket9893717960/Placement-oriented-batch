In java, static blocks and static initialization are mechanisms used to
initialize static data members of a class.
      -----------------------------------------------------------
                        Static Block?
A static block is a block of code inside a class that is enclosed in static
. It is executed only once, when the class is first loaded into memory
before any object are created or any static methods/variables are accessed.
   Syntax:
public class MyClass {
    static {
        // static initialization code
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method executed");
    }
}
   Output:
Static block executed  
Main method executed


                        Static Initialization?
Static initialization refers to assigning values to static variables, either:
1. Directly during declaration, or
2. Using a static block if more complex logic is required.
     Example:
public class Example {
    static int a = 10; // direct static initialization
    static int b;

    static {
        // complex static initialization
        b = a * 2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("a = " + a);
        System.out.println("b = " + b);
    }
}
     Output:
     a = 10  
     b = 20
