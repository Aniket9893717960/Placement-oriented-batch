Now it's a good time to talk about how to take input from user
i know u are the preple waiting for the long time because
we have talk about different concepts

May be u have this question in your mind ok 
Everything looks good we talk about 'objects classes
,inheritance and polymorphism'.

But how we take it from the user because in between 
i maintoined that what if the value will come from the 
user and at the same point you were thinking how?

So ok we talk about this in 'video no 92'.

So, basically if you want to print something on the console
we just say
        System.out.println();
ok u just understand this first that 'println' is a method
if i asked u somthing that about it that 'println' method
belongs to which class or it's the method of which class.

it's an interview question where allot of prople say that
'println' is the method of 'System' class but that's not
the case.

See if i press my button on 'Windows' or 'shift' then
and i will click on 'println' is a method which belongs to
'Printstream'. 

Here 'PrintStream' is a class and 'println' is the method of 
this class. That means if you want to call 'println' u have 
to first create an object of the 'PrintStream'.

But don't worry about this u don't want to create an object 
the bueaty is the object is already created u already have an
'out' object. 

And we are using this object from a long time.
'out' is the object of 'PrintStream' but this 
object is created as the 'static' variable inside the
'System.class' 

So, since 'PrintStream' is 'static' we can use 'out' with the
help of 'System.out' and 1's u got access to the 'out' object
u can call 'println' and that's what we have here
