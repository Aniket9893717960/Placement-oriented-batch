Spring loC (Inversion Of Control) Container is the core of the Spring
Framework. It creates objects(beans), configures them, injects dependencies
and manages their life cycles. The container uses Dependency Injection(DI)
to manage application components. 
It retrieves object configuration from XML files, Java Based Configuration,
annotations or POJOs. Since the Spring LoC container, not the developer,
controls the object lifecycle and dependency management, this concept called
Inversion Of Control (loC).

   *Spring loC Container
The Spring loC container is the core of the Spring framework. It is 
responsible for managing the lifecycle of beans and their dependencies.
There are two types of loC containers in Spring:

 1. BeanFactory
      The BeanFactory is the most basic version of the loC container.
      It provides basic support for dependency injection and bean
      lifecycle management.
      It is suitable for lightweight applications where advanced features
      are not required.
 2. ApplicationContext:
      The ApplicationContext is an advancement of the BeanFactory and 
      provides additional freatures like event propagation, 
      internationalization and more.
      It is the preferrad choice for most Spring applications due to its
      advanced capabilities.

        #KEY FEATURES OF LOC CONTAINER
Are Listed Below:
 *Dependency Injection: Automatically injects dependencies into our
                        classes.
 *Lifecycle Management: Manages the lifecycle of beans, including 
                        instantiation, initialization and deletion.
 *Configuration Flexibility: Supports both XML - based and annotation 
                             based configurations.
 *Loose Coupling: Promotes loose coupling by decoupling the 
                  implementation of objects from their usage.

        #UNDERSTANDING LOC IN SPRING WITH A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE
Step 1: Create the Sim Interface
    So, now let's understand what is loC in Spring with an example.
Suppose we have one interface named Sim and it has some abstract methods
calling() and data().
EXAMPLE:
    // Java Program to Illustrate Sim Interface
     public interface Sim {
        void calling();
        void data();
     }

Step 2: Implement the Sim interface
   Now we have created another two classes, Airtel and Jio which 
implement the Sim interface and override it's methods..
Example:
   public class Airtel implements Sim {
   @Override
    public void calling() {
      System.out.println("Airtel Calling");
    }
    @Override
    public void data(){
     System.out.println("Airtel Data");
    }
   }
  public class Jio implements Sim {
   @Override
   public void calling(){
     System.out.println("Jio Calling");
   }
    @Override
    public void data(){
     System.out.println("Jio Data");
    }
   }

Step 3: Calling Methods Without Spring loC
 Without Spring loC, we would manually create instance of the Sim 
 implementation in the main method. For example:
  public class Mobile {
   // Main driver Method
   public static void main(String[] args){
    // Manually creating an instance of Jio
    Sim sim = new Jio();
    // Calling methods
    sim.calling();
    sim.data();
    }
  }

This approach tightly couples the 'Mobile' class to the Jio 
implementation.
if we want to switch to Airtel, we need to modify the source code.
