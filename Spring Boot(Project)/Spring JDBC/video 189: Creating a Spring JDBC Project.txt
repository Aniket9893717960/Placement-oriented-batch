So, let's start our journey of creating a project with "Spring MVC + H2"
First we go to "SPRING INITIALIZER".
i. write the project build tool is 'Maven'. 
ii. Language "Java".
iii. Spring Boot version '3.2.0'
iv. let's say group id is "com.telusko". let's set the 'ArtifactId' as
'SpringJDBCEx'.
v. 'Description' of this project is 
   "Demo project for Spring Boot and JDBC".
vi. 'Packaging' i stick to 'jar'.
vii. 'Version' i choose is '17'. Also suggest that u have to choose the
     lartest LTS version.
viii. Add Dependencies which we have required 
      a. We need Spring JDBC when we search for 'JDBC' we got 'JDBC Api'
         name.
      b. we have to add for Database So, we search for 'H2'.
ix. Then click on generate -> Unzip folder -> Open in intellij idea.

After all this things when we actually open the 'pom.xml' file
Now below is the dependencies which we added in 'SpringJDBCEx'.
CODE:
    <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

Now we need some things like
 i. we need a class which we are going to work with even before that 
    i will make sure that 'SpringjdbcExApplication' will run properly or
    not.

Now the Question is which kind of 'Entity' we are going to wrok with 
what we are trying to achieve here. So, the logic is not important we are
here to learn about spring, JDBC  and Spring Boot.
So, the logic is not important we are here to build the application for 
'Student' management.

let's say "adding student", "retrieving student","Delete Student" if u want SO, that's what we are doing here.
If u want the complex example then your welcome here just write whatever
code u want but conecpts are important so i focusing on them.

Ok so, first thing i want to done that i want to create the student class
. 'Student' will have certain things right Just like i wanted to say 
'Java Class' name 'Student'.
