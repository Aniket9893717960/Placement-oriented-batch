                         What are Objects in Javascript?
                         -------------------------------
Before we start talking up the features of Javascript Objects, let's 
first understand the proper definition:

Objects : Javascript Objects are fundamentals data structure that
          enables the organisation and storage of data in the form
          of key - value pairs.
             -----------------
Objects are the collection of key and value pairs. These 
key and values  pairs known as properties.

                          OBJECT CREATION IN JAVASCRIPT
                          -----------------------------
there can be typically four ways to create an Object in Javascript.
1)         Using 'Object' literal.
2)         Using 'new' keyword.
3)         Using  'Object.create()' method.
4)         Using 'Factory' functions.
5)         Using 'Constructor' functions.

     i. Using 'Object' literal
     -------------------------
This is the most common, easiest and straightforward way to create an 
object. We can define the object and it's properties using the object
literals.

Object literals is a list of key - value pairs enclosed in curly braces '{}'.
Example :                         let person = {};
                          console.log(typeof(person));       // Output : object
         -------------------NOTE--------------
Every Object has properties, which are represented in Javascript as
key - value pairs.

Key : In javascript key must either be strings or valid identifier or variables
       names. Expressions cannot be keys, also special characters are not allowed 
in key names that are not strings.

value : Value can be anything such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, 
        functions and even objects.
Example : let's add some properties such as firstName, lastName, age, hobbies
          and a message function to be person objects.

                 let person = {
                 firstName : "Mayank",
                 lastName  : "Panday",
                 age : 21,
                 hobbies : ["reading", "writing", "painting"],
                 message : function() {
                    console.log("Hi my name is"+ this.firstName);
                   }
                  };
        ----NOTE---
When a function is a property of an object, it is also referred to
as a method. In the above example message property is a 'function'
Which is also called as 'method'.

   ii. Using 'new' keyword
   ------------------------
we can use the 'new' keyword along with the 'Object' constructor to 
create an empty object and then add properties and methods to it.
Example :
i.      Let's create an empty person object using new keyword.
                    let person = new Object();
                     console.log(person);         // Output : {}
ii. Let's add some properties such as firstName, lastName, age to the 
    empty object created using new keyword.
                    let person = new Object();
                    person.firstName = "Mayank";
                    person.lastName = "Panday";
                    person. hobbies = ["reading","sleeping","writing"];
                       console.log(person);

                    /* Output :
                    {
                      firstName: 'Mayank',
                      lastName: 'Pandey',
                      hobbies: [ 'reading', 'sleeping', 'writing' ]
                    }
                    */
   iii. Using  'Object.create()' method
   ------------------------------------
'Object.create{}' is another ,method to create objects. However, it involves an
additional step compared to some other object creation methods. First, a
prototype object is created before. Then, new objects are created using
that prototype. 
Afterward, properties can be added or modified on the newly created object.
Example :                 let personPrototype = {
                             name : "Mayank"
                            };
                    let person = Object.create(personPrototype);
                         console.log(person);                       // output : {}
                -------------NOTE--------------------------
An important thing to note is while, we are using 'Object.create()',
this method creates a new empty object. In the above example
person is a new empty object.
