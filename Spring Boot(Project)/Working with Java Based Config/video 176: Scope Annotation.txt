So, by default every 'bean' will be 'SingleTon'. That means when u 
load your application It will create the container And in that container
object will be available.
                         which object?
At this point we are working with one particular 'bean' which is 'Desktop'
we not working particular 'Alien'. we not working with 'Laptop'.
So, those object's are not going created.

That's why in the output no one says 'laptop' object created.
Or object created for 'Alien'
