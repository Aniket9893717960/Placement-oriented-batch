So, our project is ready, i mean the structure is ready. Now let's create 
a servlet. Now if you think about creating something in java, So, lelt's
say if you want to create a feature, we create a class right?

So, here also if you want to create a servlet, u have to create a class.
So, what i will do is i will just go back to my project. I'll right click
here and say new.

let me create a simple class here and we'll name this class as, let's say
"HelloServlet". Of course you can name anything you want, but having a 
servlet at the send defines or it tells the developers that, 
"hey, this is a servlet, right?".
CODE:
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet {
    }

So, use a proper name. So, we got "HelloServlet". The only purpose ofthis
"HelloServlet" is to greet the user. So, whatever you want to do, maybe you want to say "hello world" or something.

I just want to show something on the screen. Okay, so this is ourservlet,
But is it? Just by writing this as a servlet, will it make a servlet?
Of course Not. We have to do some extra thing as well.

See, one of the way to give the feature of a servlet to this class is by 
extending a class called "HttpServlet".
CODE:
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    }

If you talk about servlet, it has multiple features, right?
