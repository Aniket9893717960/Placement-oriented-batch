Now basically when u talk about applications,
I'm talking about enterprise level application.
Now, initally those application used to stay in on permise.
Basically every company will have their own servers and they will 
deploy the application on their own servers.

but then we have talked about cloud, right? Now most of the companies
are moving from on premise to cloud. So, basically all the services 
which we are using nowadays is cloud based.

Even the public application like Google Docs, Dropbox, Gmail, everything 
is cloud. Now the application which are used internally in the company,
they are also deployed on the cloud.

 Of course Not every Company is moving into it.
 but majorly, most of the applications are on cloud nowadays.
 Now, the moment u talk about cloud applications, We have 
 Two interesting terms here:
   CLOUD READY                         CLOUD NATIVE

It's IMP to understand difference b/w this 2. What we expect from the 
 cloud application is the cloud services. The moment u talk about
 cloud, it provides a lot of different benefits, right?

 Benefits in term of cost. 
 Benefits in term of scaling.
 Benefits in term of less issues.

 Now. if u want to achieve that, of course, U have to make an application
 which will use all those services and which will fullfill the promises,
 right?
