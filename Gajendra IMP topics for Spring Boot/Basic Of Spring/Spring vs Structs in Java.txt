Understanding the difference b/w Spring and struts framework is important
for Java Developers, as both frameworks serve distinct purpose in building 
web applications. The main difference lies in their design and functionality.

 Spring: Spring is a comprehensive, modular framework offering dependency
         Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming and extensive integration
         capabilities for enterprise application.
 Struts: Struts is an action based MVC framework primarily focused on 
         web applications, with less flexibility and integration compared 
         to spring.

                  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPRING AND STRUTS
The table below demonstrate the difference b/w Spring and Struts.

                          SPRING FRAMEWORK
 Modular, portable and testable Java applications can be formed using 
 the open source Spring framework. It is a standard for developing web
 apps and can be used over J2EE aka Java to Enterprise Edition 
 applications.
 This handles the infrastructure and makes the codes reusable and 
 testable thereby enhancing their performance. It works on an inversion
 of control loC and dependency injection concept. It is also used to 
 decrease the coupling between the modules of the program.

     *Spring Framework Architecture
                       DIAGRAM u have to add
The Spring framework is modular and consists of several modules that
provide different functionalities to help build enterprise applications.
The modules can be broadly categorized into four main areas: 
Core Container, Data Access/Intergration, Web and Miscellaneous.

                        STRUTS FRAMEWORKS
Struts is a framework based on MVC architecture that stands for model
view and Controller architecture. It is an open source platform and is
used to develop enterprise edition web application.
It has a request handler and response handler because It is based on 
request based framework which handles the request from the user.
AJAX,REST and SOAP are supported by struts.

     *Working Of Struts
 The below diagram demonstrates the working of Struts.
*Client Request: The client sends an HTTP request, which is received by
                 the File Dispatcher (typically the Struts front 
                 Controller, such as struts.xml).
*Action Invocation: The File Dispatcher processes the request and  
                    invokes the appropriate Action class, passing 
                    through interceptors for preprocessing 
          (e.g., validation, logging, authentication).
*Action Processing: The Action class executes the business logic and 
                    interacts with the model layer to process data.
*Result Generation: The Action returns a Result, which determines the 
                    view (e.g., a JSP page) to be displayed to the 
                    client.
*Response to Client: The HTTP response is generated and sent back to the
                     client, rendering the final view.
