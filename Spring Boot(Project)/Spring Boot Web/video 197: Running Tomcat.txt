So, our project is ready, i mean the structure is ready. Now let's create 
a servlet. Now if you think about creating something in java, So, lelt's
say if you want to create a feature, we create a class right?

So, here also if you want to create a servlet, u have to create a class.
So, what i will do is i will just go back to my project. I'll right click
here and say new.

let me create a simple class here and we'll name this class as, let's say
"HelloServlet". Of course you can name anything you want, but having a 
servlet at the send defines or it tells the developers that, 
"hey, this is a servlet, right?".
CODE:
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet {
    }

So, use a proper name. So, we got "HelloServlet". The only purpose ofthis
"HelloServlet" is to greet the user. So, whatever you want to do, maybe you want to say "hello world" or something.

I just want to show something on the screen. Okay, so this is ourservlet,
But is it? Just by writing this as a servlet, will it make a servlet?
Of course Not. We have to do some extra thing as well.

See, one of the way to give the feature of a servlet to this class is by 
extending a class called "HttpServlet".
CODE:
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    }

If you talk about servlet, it has multiple features, right? Accepting 
the request from the user and responding to the user. So, basically for 
request and response, we need special objects.

                 ____________NOTE______________
And the way you can get that if you extend a class by 'HttpServlet'.So, 
basically we need 2 things the request and the response, and also we 
need a method which will execute whenever you get the request.
                 -------------X-----------------

which method i talk about? So basically i have to create a method here.
We use 'public' acess modifier with return type 'void' method name
Is "service".
CODE:
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
     public void service(){}
    }

What is 'service'?Now 'Service' is one of the important method in 
servlet,  which gets executed whenever you send a request. Okay?
now question arrise How will you accept the data from the client?
See, in this example, I don't want to send any data from client to
server.

Which u want to send the request,but i want to send the data back to the
client. but let's say if you are working on real life and you want to
send some data from the client to the server, you need an object from 
where you can do that And that's where in the 'service' we have to pass
two parameters, one for the request.
one for the response.

And the request respone will get in the form of "HttpServlet request".
This is a special interface which has multiple methods to work with,
but we don't have to define those methods.

The internal implementation will do it for you, okay? So, we just have to
create the object for this or the reference for this, which will be 
called request And 'HttpServletResponse'.

So, this tool we need. Now whatever data coming from the client will be
stored in request object, and whatever data you want to send back to the 
client.

That will be present in the response object. Or u can add that into 
response object. Okay, So, instead of requesting object or responding at 
this point, what i want to do Is i just to check if this method is 
getting called.
CODE At this point in 'HelloServlet'.java
    package org.aniket;
    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    public void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res){
       System.out.println("In Service");
      }
    }
