Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework to create stand - alone
RESTful web applications with very minimal configuration and there is no
need of external servers to run the application because it has embedded 
servers like Tomcat and Jetty etc.
   Spring Boot framework is independent
   It creates executable spring applications that are production - grade.
