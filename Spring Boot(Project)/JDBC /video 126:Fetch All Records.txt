So, we insert the data in database then we can fetch the
data with different IDs with the help of Queries.

'insert into student values (2,'kiran',50)'
     Now we want is to fetch the data and show it into the java code
Just i want to print all not just 1 because at this point we are just 
printing only names of all 4 rows and 3 columns.

How do we done that first of all let's change the query
we don't know how many rows are there in this case we know there are
4 rows but in generall we don't know but if we done it in automated way
what you can use it u choose a loop here and this loop will run till u
have the data.

but how u know what kind of data do you have how much rows u have
u can use someting 
'rs.next()' this 'rs.next()' have multiple things 

1st it will check
do we have the next row if it yes we shift this in the next row
that's why 'rs.next' will basically runs for all the rows because
'rs.next' will basically runs for the next row.

2nd 'rs.next' also make sure that it's shifting to the 'new' row
So, that done we are basically jumping from row to row.

But the question is what is the data you are going to return because
we are filling a query which will return all three columns.
So, in this case we return all three columns or u can print it 
something like this instead of printing in a new line.

U can print the first data 'rs.getInt' because that's the integer type
right Now u have the choice u can maintoined the column no.
But the only thing is u have to remember the sequence. 

        while(rs.next()){
            System.out.print(rs.getInt(1));
        }
