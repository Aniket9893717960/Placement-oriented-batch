ApplicationContext belongs to the Spring framework. Spring loC container
is responsible for instantiating, wiring, configuring and managing the 
entire life cycle of beans or objects.

BeanFactory and ApplicationContext represent the Spring loC Containers.
ApplicationContext is the sub-interface of BeanFactory. It is used when
we are creating an enterprise - level application or web application.

ApplicationContext is the superset of BeanFactory, whatever features
provided by BeanFactory are also provided by ApplicationContext.

                   APPLICATIONCONTEXT FEATURES
Provide basic features in addition to enterprise - specific functionalities
which are as follows:
  Publishing events to registered listeners by resolving property files.
  Methods for accessing application components.
  Supports internationalization.
  Loading file resources in a generic fashion.
                    -------NOTE----------
It is beacuse of these additional features, developers prefer to use
ApplicationContext over BeanFactory.
  Spring - BeanFactory: It provides basic functionalities and is 
                        recommended for use for lightweight applications
      like mobile and applets.

            APPLICATIONCONTEXT IMPLEMENTATION CLASSES
There are different types of Application containers provided by Spring
for different requirements as listed below which later onwards are 
described alongside with declaration, at lastly providing an example to 
get through the implementation part with the pictorial aids.
Containers are as follows:
  1. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext container
  2. AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
  3. XmlWebApplicationContext
  4. FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
  5. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext

      CONTAINER 1: AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
This Class was introduced in Spring 3.0. It accepts classes annotated 
with @Configuration, @Components and JSR-330 compliant classes. The 
Constructor of 'AnnotationConfigApplicationContext' accepts one or more 
classes.
For Example, in below declaration, two Configuration classes 'AppConfig'
and 'AppConfig1' are passed as arguments to the constructor. The Beans
defined in later classes will override the same type and name beans in 
earlier classes when passed as arguments.
For example, AppConfig and AppConfig1 have the same bean declaration.
The bean defined in AppConfig1 overrides the beam in AppConfig.

Syntax: Declaration  CODE:
    ApplicationContext context = new 
  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class ,AppConfig1.class);
                -----------NOTE-------------
Add the following to the properties file in the IDE to allow the spring
to override beans.
CODE:
      spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true.
                ------------X---------------

      CONTAINER 2: AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
This class was introduced in Spring 3.0. It is similar to 
AnnotationCofigApplicationContext for a web environment. It accepts 
classes annotated with '@Configuration','@Component' and JSR-330 
compliant classes.
These classes can be registered via 'register()' method or passing base 
packages to 'scan()' method. This class may be used when we configure
'ContextLoaderListener' servlet listener or a 'DispatcherServlet' in a
'web.xml'.
From Spring 3.1, this class can be instantiated and injected to 
DispatcherServlet using java code by implementing 
WebApplicationInitializer, an alternative to 'web.xml'.
Example: CODE:
  //Class
  //Implementatiog WebApplicationInitializer

  public class MyWebApplication implements WebApplicationInitializer {
      // Servlet container
public void onStartup(ServletContext container) throws ServletException {
    AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context = new
      AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
    context.register(AppConfig.class);
    context.setServletContext(container);
      // Servlet configuration
    }
  }

              CONTAINER 3: XmlWebApplicationContext
Spring MVC Web based Application can be configured completely using
XML or Java code. Configuring this container is similar to the 
AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext container, which implies we can
configure it in web.xml or using java code.
CODE:
    //Class
    // Implementing WebApplicationInitializer
    public class MyXmlWebApplicationInitializer implements 
    WebApplicationInitializer {
      // Servlet Container
public void onStartup(ServletContext container) throws ServletException{
    XmlWebApplicationContext context = new XmlWebApplicationContext();
    context.setConfigLocation("/WEB-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml");
    context.setServletContext(container);
      //Servlet configuration
      }
    }

            CONTAINER 4: FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext is used to load Xml based Spring
Configuration files from the file system or from URL. We can get the
application context using Java code. 
It is useful for standalone environments and test harnesses. The 
following code shows how to create a container and use the XMl as 
metadata information to load the beans.
     Illustration: CODE:
String path =
"Documents/demoproject/src/main/resources/applicationcontext/
 student-bean-config.xml";
 ApplicationContext context = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(path);
 AccountService accountService = context.getBean("studentService"
  ,StudentService.class);

            CONTAINER 5: ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext is used to load Xml based Spring 
Configuration files from the classpath. We can get the application
context using Java code.
It is useful for standalone environements and test harnesses. The 
following code shows how to create a container and use the XML as
metadata information to load the beans.
