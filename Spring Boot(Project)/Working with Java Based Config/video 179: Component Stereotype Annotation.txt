Till this point we talk about the 'xml Configuration' and we have used 
'java based Configuration' as well. In which we have talk about 
multiple annotation like
 @Configuration  @Bean   @Primary
And with this things are working out. So, we are quite happy
So, the main question is are We?
So, the thing is when we say that spring will make your work easy 
Then we expect that 'Spring' will done things automatically.

Specially when we started with 'spring boot'. And we got to know 
that spring boot will make your work very easy. 
In spring as well without using spring boot. we get that easy part
But looking at the configuration we are not that happy.

Even if it's your 'XML COnfiguration' or your java based Configuration
