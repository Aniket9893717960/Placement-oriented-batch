U know if we manually want to connect client with database help of
'Spring JDBC' then we have to follow so, many steps:
1. Load Driver
2. Define COnnection URL
3, Establish Connection
4. Create Statement Object
5. Execute Query Using Statement
6. Process Result
7. Close Connection

This so many steps we do and to solve this problem we got something called
'Spring JDBC' now this also has so many things to it.
we also have so many components to work with one of the most important 
component which we have to work is 'JdbcTemplate'.

Now this 'Template' which help u to done certain things are as follows:
1. Connect with Database
2. To fire the queries
3. Process Data
4. Get Output

Also when u want to connect with Database see normally what happens is 
when u are sending the request U have to create the connection.
But if u send the second request again u have to send the connection.
U doesn't thing why we use multiple connections.

Why we doesn't use the same connection. What if your system already have
3-4 connection in the database and u send the request. why we doesn't use
the same connection available Now that's something u can get help from the
'Data Source'.

So, we use 'Data Source' with the help of some libraries. 
And again u don't have to download the library manually. Spring will
give it to u.
