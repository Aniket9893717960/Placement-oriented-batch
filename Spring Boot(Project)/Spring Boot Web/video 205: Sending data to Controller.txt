So we got the home page which is "Hello World". but then we don't want a 
simple page here, right? Maybe i want to perform some operation.

So, the entire idea of having a backend is where a user will request for some
thing. Maybe u want to add two no., simplest stuff. or u want to find the
data about something or may be u want to see the listing of a product by
a price.

So, basically what u're doing is a client sends a request for the server,
server does some processing and give something back to the client.
Now at this point I don't want to get into complex logic. because we are 
here to learn Spring framework, not to make complex logic.

And that's why we go for the simple example.
                     HOW DO WE ADD TWO NUMBERS?
Now why we are doing this for a simple reason, we want to send some data to
the server. We want to ask server, Hey. u know u have to do something for me
Server say "Okay, we'll do it."

Give back the data to the client. That's the process we want to achieve.
So, how do we do that? So, first of all, in this 'HomePage', I don't
want to simply print a hello world.

Maybe i want to add two numbers and to achieve that, first of all, u 
need a page where u can add two numbers. So, what i will do is I need a 
form here. So, they can submit data.

So, they can submit data. So, when i say form, it means i need two text 
field. I need a button where i can click the button and this two text 
field data should go to the server.

And for that we have to create a form. Now instead of wasting our time 
writing the code, I do have the code with me. So, that's our form.
U can see i'm using a label for enter the first no.
