let's implement SQL But before we do that first 
we have to make certain changes which we are working on
  So, first of all i need the simple class. Yes we got 'alien'
  we got 'laptop' but let's say we work with new the term laptop
  even laptop is new for us.
  because laptop is a very simple class we got an 'lid','brand',
  'model' and 'ram'.

And if you look at the data for this So, let's open our 'admin'
  'pg.admin' and if u see the data for the 'laptop' basically we
  got this 3 Details
So, what can i do is i will go back to my code and in this i want
to check one more thing. I don't want to be 'create' now in
'hibernate.clg.xml' this time i write 'update' otherwise i loose 
my data.

Program write on 'Main.java' Is:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){

        Laptop l1 = new Laptop();
        l1.setLid(5);
        l1.setBrand("Asus");
        l1.setModel("Strix");
        l1.setRam(32);

        SessionFactory sf = new Configuration()
                .addAnnotatedClass(org.aniketdb1.Laptop.class)
                .configure()
                .buildSessionFactory();

        Session session = sf.openSession();


        Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();

        session.persist(l1);

        tx.commit();
        session.close();
        sf.close();
    }
}
