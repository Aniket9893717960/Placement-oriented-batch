Now in this video we try to implement 'try' with 'finally' or
'try with resources' basically firstly i remove Every thing 
and we try to use 'bufferedReader' because we love it.

here we are not running code as of now than we have to remove 
'throws IOException' as well and here what ever we do is
we have to understand 'try' now if we talk about try

of course in this 'try' what u will do whatever u want
Normally we put critical statements in this right and if 
this will be a critical statements what u will execute is the
catch block.

we know how to add the catch block it's compulsory to have 
a 'try' with 'catch' so, there is no compulsion if you can
see i don't maintoin catch it gives an error.

So, the thing is if you have a try and if you don't want to 
maintion the 'catch' u can basically write 'finally' here.

so, yes try can be use either 'finally' and 'catch'. but 
there is a Question that
what is the use of try if u don't handling it? why this question 
apper because

if 'try' have the critical statement than 'try' will 'throw'
an exception and 'catch' block will catch it
But there is something u want to print at every condition
not matter if your code will perfectly Exceuted or not.

Because there are some set of statements which u want to
exceute irrespective if you got Exception or Not.

Instead of doing those things at 'try' and 'catch' block
we got an ammessing thing which is 'finally'. 
You can write your statements inside 'finally' block.

And the bueaty is if you want to skip 'catch' block than u 
also done that and only run 'try-catch'.

Finally make sense whenever you want to close the resource.
The only thing is we are creating an object inside the try block.
so, i can decalse the reference of 'BufferedReader' outside the 
'try-catch' block.
And i can initialize 'BufferedReader' as 'null'.

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Demo {
 public static void main(String args[]) throws NumberFormatException 
 {
 int num =0;
 BufferedReader  br = null;
 try
 {
  br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  num = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
  System.out.println(num);
  }
  finally {
   br.close();
  }
 }

But u know we can optimize this more in the later version of java
they have introduce a new concept which is 'try with resources'
where u don't even have to maintoin 'finally' block.

That's good right But how u do that so, in 'try' we have round bracket
"()" and u create you declaration what ever object u have creating 
create them inside the 'try' block bracket "()".

And you have to Declare them as well so, u don't need to maintoin at uper 
body.
so, whenever you have the class or interface which is 'AutoClosable' u don't 
need to maintoined that to close it with the help of 'try'.
So, this is 'try' with resources

public class Demo {
 public static void main(String args[]) throws NumberFormatException 
 {
 int num =0;
 try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));)
 {
  num = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
  System.out.println(num);
  }
 }


---------------------X-----------------------
wherenver you want to close the connection or Resource always
close the 'finally' block. because this block will made for closing the 
resources.
It can be for files, for the input,for the connections (like network,Database Connection)
'finally' block used for closing this connection.
