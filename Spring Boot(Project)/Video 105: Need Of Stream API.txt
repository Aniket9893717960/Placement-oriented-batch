Before Start with 'Stream API' First of all it's a New concept come in
java 1.8 and it provides some Amazing features The first point is 
why do we need those features we need to understand that first.
              ---------NOTE--------------
For avoid manually add Specific Data in the List one by one
we add all the data in the List with the help of 
'asList' method :It will gives you a list and it belong to a class
--------         called 'Arrays'
Syntax : 
      List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4,5,7,2);
              -------------X------------
If we print 'nums' values then at output we got the values of
'nums'.
But if i don't want all the values just i want some specific values 
like let's say i want only Even value and Double Each value and also
take the submition of all.
For this we use 'for' loop like this
              int sum =0;
              for(int n : nums){
                  if(n%2 == 0){
                      n = n*2;
                        sum = sum +n;
                     }
                 }                       //It's Output is 24
But It's Not necessay that all the time u perform the simple operations it's also 
the operations in which u have to change the overall values.
For Performing this we have Provided 'Stream API'.

                          Stream API
                          ----------
It's the part of 'java.util.stream' package. If we click on 'Stream' tham
u can see that 'Stream' is an Interface. IT Provide multiple method like
'filter' to filter out the data.
If you want to chnage the value Example we have double ended the value 
This will done with the help of 'map' method.
And We individually see this method later.
'Stream' will provide a lot of method to work with this.

             --------------------------------------
     At last is For, Enhanced For, For Each loop
