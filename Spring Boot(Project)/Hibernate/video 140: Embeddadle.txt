Till this point we were able to store the object because this object has 
very simple values.
Talking about Integer, String all this are basic java types And also
on the database side.
we are using JDBC here we have something called JDBC type with Checks
we have 'Int' so what we need in Database to basically try to match it.
For             Int  we got           Integer  there
                char we got           Varchar there
But what if u got the complex type.
  Example :
  let's say if we have a laptop of 
    Brand: Asus
    Model: ROG
    RAM : 16 GB
    CPU : i7
    Graphics: RTX 3060

U know this details will be visible like this:
    12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12450HX   2.40 GHz
    
And we want to fatch specific value's in this String So, 
    To store this in string is not a good idea.

So, what we can do is we can generate the Seperate class here
  Which is of type laptop in 'org.aniket12' package

In those 'Laptop' class we store private variables
