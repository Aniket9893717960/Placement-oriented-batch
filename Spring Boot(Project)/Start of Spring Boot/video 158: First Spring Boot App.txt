First We see the simple example of "Dependency Injection"
Now the question arrise which IDE we are going to use 
We already Seen Different IDE's like VS code, Intellij Idea,
Eclipse And NetBeans.

We just start with Eclipse and then moving to intellij
Let's Start with 'Eclipse'
                 ---------
first click on 'Create a project' then it will ask u
what kind of project u building then click on 'Maven'
Project. It will gives u an option of adding dependency.

But Instead of "Maven" we have "spring Boot" So, we get the option of 
Spring boot
