So, let's work with 'ManyToMany' Now to that Example we have to convert it
is So, first of all 'One' alien will got multiple laptop Instead of having 
'OneToMany' here we say 'ManyToMany' And Remove this 
"(mappedBy = 'alien')" as of now
                       This changes done on 'Alien' side

On the 'laptop' side we have to done changes because here
one laptop belongs to one 'Alien' So, in this case we build
the List of Aliens because a laptop can belongs to multiple 
'Alien' and import as well.
At upper we also say '@ManyToMany'.
            import java.util.List
            @ManyToMany
            private List<Alien> aliens;

And also re-create the 'Getter's and Setter's' for List of Aliens
And we not printing it in 'toString' so, doesn't change in 'toString'.

Now we come to main and here we can do some changes because
Now when u are setting an 'Alien' we are saying
          'a1.setLaptops(Arrays.asList(l1, l2));'

For 'Alien' we also doing the same thing but before i do that we create a 
one more laptop So, let say we got 3 laptop here
At 3rd we set the data name("3","Apple","Macbook",8).
So, we got 3 laptop And we also adding the data in 'Alien'.
("102","Harsh","Python"),("103","Kiran","AI").
