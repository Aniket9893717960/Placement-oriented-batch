'Code your First Program in html'
this is our main goal u have to achive
at this file.

First we have to start with the Question that
 'what is html?'
if i am a collage professior then i spake 
'It is Hyper text Markup Language'

But the 'main' thing is what is exactly 'HTML'
is 'It's full form is not enough for me.'

Here is the Answer of given Question
Is "Html is a language which use to 
define structure of the Data."

In the journey of mern stack we study about
'html','css','Javascript' make him with the ruff 
defination.

If i talk about html then HTML means 'what?'
          HTML -> what?
if we are sowing the website the 'what?'
portion in this will define by 'html' tag.
"  'HTML' main work is to label the things"

'CSS' means to make the styling/appearence
'Javascript' is our brain.

---------------------------------X--------------------------------------------------------
Now the Actual start of an HTML.

HTML -> language which define structure
Example : If we have a web-page and in this
         we define allot of content(image, text, video)
To label the content one by one to define 'who is what?'
This  job is done by 
                  'HTML' which provide structure and description
of your web page.

# Structure of HTML
  -----------------
"<!DOCTYPE html>" it means that the whole code u have written it's type is 
                  HTML5 language.

"<html>" if we try to written the document of html so, it's important that the
         code should be inclosed in 'html' tag.
         Here 'html' is kind of a root element.

"<head>" Every mata/SEO/title data of your website.U have to maintoin it
         At '<head>' tag to use 'mata/SEO/title' king of data.

"Meta Data": if u google search the certain web site and u observe there
             is something description is given on him's website before 
             opening the actual website it's an example of 'meta' data.

"<body> tag": If you try to maintoin content in the web page with 
              with the help of labels('tags') those all content
              comes under 'body' tag.
              This will help to display the actual content on an html
              web page.
          -------X-----
tags: every tag will provide the utility of something.

Element : If we combine the whole thing from opening to
          closing that it all come under one Entity called
          Elements.
          Example:  <html> ------------ </html>
                            html element
