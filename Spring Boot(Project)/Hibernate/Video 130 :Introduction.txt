So, Now we focus on "Hibernate".
If u want to build an application or let's say console based application
we are quite happy with java and JDBC and if u want to build a backend
application or a web - application we can use servlets.

Now that's an old technology but even if you work with spring MVC
Which we will seen in future is based on servlets

Ok so, let's keep it aside If u want to build an application so the
Java JDBC is enough so, why we are going with spring in the upcoming
sessions There are Two reasons.
        i. To imporve the Software.
        ii. To improve the Productivity with Software.

If u want to increase we use 'HIBERNATE' instead of using the plane JDBC
I only saying this if you worked with JDBC and we have seen that before
we have to done the lot of steps to store the data in database and 
java is an object oriented language So, everything there is an object.

Or in the database side we have relation so, to mark those connectivity
so, we have to manually write those SQL Queries Now we will done this with
the help of 'HIBERNATE'. 

In fact if we talk about spring there is a module in spring which is 
'SPRING DATA JPA' it will talk about the similar things u have doesn't
write the query but if u chose to don't work with data JPA.

And also u want to know what ORM works we seen in the next Video.
