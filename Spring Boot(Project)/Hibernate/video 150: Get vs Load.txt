Or We can see 'Eager' fetching vs 'leazy' fetching. Yes in the previous 
videos we also see there is a concept of 'Eager' and 'Lazy' when u are
talking about 'Mapping' relationship.

we had the fetching concept we can do it with 'Eager' and by default
  we talk about collection we go with 'lazy' SO, we will full focus 
  on get and load.
'get' we have used and 'load' is already 'deprecated' but we show u what 
it does and we also talk what is the alternate use when we don't want to
use load what else we can use.
  If we back to the code of 'HidProj' we done for 'HQL'
we don't need the 'fetch' methods here.
Here is the code.    
   String brand = "Asus";
   Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like ?1");
   query.setParameter(1, brand);
  List<Objects[]> laptops = query.getResultList();
