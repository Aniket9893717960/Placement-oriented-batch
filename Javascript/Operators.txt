First we have to understand
                           What is operators?
This is something related to Operations.
There are specific symbols which used to perform
Specific Operations.
Just like            '+' used to perform Addition
                     '-' used to perform Subtration
                     '*' used to perform Multiplication
                     '/' used to perform Division

                            TYpes of OPerators
                           --------------------
         i. Arithmetic Operator
         ----------------------
In Arithmetic Operator we have the following kind of 
Operators available are as follows :
+ - * / %  **
            |-> Power Sign
++  --
In this we have two type of operator 
    a. unary operator         
                     It's a single Operand.
               ++  --
Pre Increment<-|
--- ---------    First increment than use
PostIncrement<-|
-------------    Use than increment
             This two operators are used as Pre & post.
       Example:
               ++a;
    b. binary operator
    + - * / %  **
            |  |-> Power Sign
            |-> It provides Remainder always
               Example of Power Symbol
                          -----
                              2**4 ->  2^4
                                    |-> Means in Mathomatics

      ii. Assignment Operator
          ----------  -------
i was talk a simple thing that
            let  a = 5;
             |     |  |-> It represent 'termination'.
             |-> let is used to create a variable.
                   |-> Assignment operator.
It will have
