Dependency Injection Is a design pattern used in Software Development -
especially in object oriented programming to reduce tight coupling between 
coupling between components.
It is a form of Inversion of Control(loC), where the control of creating 
and injecting dependencies is transferred from the class itself to an 
external framework or container (like Spring framework).
