Before starting with spring boot we have to learn one concept which
is 'loc' and 'Di'.
I know this is short forms but full form of this is 
'Inversion of Control' and 'Dependency Injection'.

Of course there are two different concept.
Let's talk about 'loc' which is 'Inversion of Control' it simply 
means that u are inverting the control but where what control u
are inverting So, as a programmer u have multiple roles.

when u write a code make sure u create the "Object" or
flow of the application. 
Now u say what's wrong with that 
And i will say "I Ok with the flow of the application but 
i not ok with the object creation".

Now u say in the start and end of the entire java we talk about
object creation and we do that with the help of new keyword.
the thing is object creation is easy 
  'of course u can write a new keyword and u get the password.'

But if u can create the object it's your responsibility to 
  'Create the object'
  'Maintain the object'
  'Destroy the object'
basically as a programmer u are controlling everything.
And that's what the problem start when u try to manage all
the things.
U are focusing all the things but u are not focusing the main
thing Which is "Business Logic".
