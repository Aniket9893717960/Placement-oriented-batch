In the previous video we talk about 'ParallelStream' Right So, in this video 
let's try to Explore the Example
Or Let's say the power of It. As i maintoined before if you want to work with
Parallel Stream And if you want to say the effective concrite u need huge amount
of data.

At this point we don't have the huge amount of data. So, let's create huge amount
of data. Let's assume that we create a list of no. let's say list of integers
here. Let's say list we input this with 'new' Array list.

           List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();

And we find this list is Empty So, let's fell this list with how may values 
Let's say '10 thousand' values can we do that
If we create a 'List' so, it has some capactiy So at '()' of 'List'
we write how many space we want we write there '10000' initially 
all the values will contains '0'.

          List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(10000);

Now how we add the '10000' values in the  list that's tricky part
       i. we use 'nums.add' to add all the values Or we can simply use the
          random class with the help of 'For' loop. You were add all the random no.
          But the Question arrise how will you add random no.

So, basically  u have the class called 'random' and we create it's object
'ran'. Like this :
                Random ran = new Random();
And 'Random' have allot of methods like 'nextInt' So, basically you can 
specify what no. you want let we give you that no. and also u maintoined 
the bound that what type of value u want
If you check under the 'nextInt' So, i want bound to be '100' but i don't 
want 1 value right.
So, i will use a 'for' loop start from i is equal to 1 and i will go for
the last value which is '10000' Or the better could be u create a variable
let's say 'size' which initialized as '10000'
And if you want to Differentiate no. of Zero's

               for(int i =1;i<=size;i++){

               }

So, in this particular loop basically i want to add the element in the 
'nums.add' so, what no. i want to 'add' it's something the random class
will give us.
So, we can say 'ran.nextInt' by doing this u got '10000' values in the list.

               for(int i =1;i<=size;i++){
                    nums.add(ran.nextInt(100));
               }

If you want to see that u actually print and see what type of values u
got there Let's see the actual Program.
 import java.util.ArrayList;
 import java.util.List;
 import java.util.Random;

  class StreamEx {
       public static void main(String args[]){
           int size = 10_00;
           List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(size);

           Random ran = new Random();

           for(int i=1;i<=size;i++){
               nums.add(ran.nextInt(100));
           }

           System.out.println(nums);
       }
  }

So, what you wanna do with this values So, i want to multiply every
value here by '2' and that's the simple thing we can do of course 
we can do a lot of different stuff but here just we try to do 
multiplication by '2'.
And we also add the values and we have done this before right
So, get the value 'multiply by 2' and find the sum out of it.

In this video we also intoduce to a new method called 'mapToInt'
which will give you a way to add all the value and we have used 
reduce before
