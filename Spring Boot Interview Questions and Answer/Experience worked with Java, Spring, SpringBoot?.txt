Yes, i have hands on experience working with java, Spring framework, and 
Spring Boot to develop robust and scalable application. Here's a brief 
overview of my expertise:

Java : Strong proficiency in Core Java (OOP, Collections, Multithreading,
       Streams, Lambda Expressions) and Java 8+ features.

Spring frameworks:Experience with Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA,
                   Spring Security and Spring AOP for building enterprise -
                   grade applications.

Spring Boot: Developed  multiple Restful APIs and microservices using 
             Spring Boot, leveraging features like auto-configuration
             embedded servers(Tomcat), and Actuator for monitoring.

Database Integration: Worked with Hibernate/JPA for ORM and connected
                      application to MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

Additional Tools: Used Maven/Gradle, Docker, Swagger/OpenAPI and 
                  Postman for development testing and deployment
