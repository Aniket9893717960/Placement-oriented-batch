this is the hierarchi or a system and why do we need it but at this point we create a hierarchi and if you talking about class which 
only have an abstract method the other alternaticve for that is to create an interface.
*Interface have a property that every methord declaration in an interface is by default 'public+abstract'
*Interface is nothing but a blueprint of a class that contains static constants and abstract methods.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java 

But how will i use this, how will i instatiate this.The same problem was there with abstract class right we cannot 
instatiate this so, we build a program to see how we instantiate this?

* If you try to create an object of Interface than it gives an error like 
"Cannot instantiate the type A".
For making the solution Firstly "What is the objective to create Interface?"
Answer)we can Create interface so that we design something.Let's say it u ask
me how to we create a table or How to reach someWhere?
Answer) here we give him the Direction/path/Design you make a walk i don't walk
for you

Here, Interface say i will tell you what are the methods you need but i will not 
implement them it's your  responsibility and job to implement.

*To implement we create another class which will implement Interface name 'A'.
But if you use 'implements' keyword it's compolsory to Define both the methods.
If you failed to define Both the method by default your class 'B' also becomes
an abstract class.

*But if u want to create a concrete class and we want to create object of 'B'.
so, it's your job to define both the methods.
To show case all the things we implemented the program  ðŸ‘‡




interface A
{
 void config();
 void show();
}

class B implements A
{
 public void show(){
 System.out.println("In show");
 }
 public void config(){
 System.out.println("In config");
 }
}

public class Demo
{
 public static void main(String args[]){
 A a;
 a = new B();
 a.show();
 a.config();
 }
}




SO, just like we create a methods in interface 'A' that's how we don't define
the variables.
we Does but if you initially just define the variable we get an error because
this are by default Defined 'static + final'.So, that means first initialize
the variable.
Because of this we directly print the value in the main method with the 
help of this command.
     " System.out.println(A.area); "
But if you try to change the value so we  got an error name
"The fianl field A.area cannot be assigned"

We all write this in program ðŸ‘‡




interface A
{
 int age=44;
 String area = "Mumbai";
 void config();
 void show();
}

class B implements A
{
 public void show(){
 System.out.println("In show");
 }
 public void config(){
 System.out.println("In config");
 }
}

public class Ts
{
 public static void main(String args[]){
 A a;
 a = new B();
 a.show();
 System.out.println(A.area); 
 a.config();
 }
}
