Spring boot has become the preferred choice over traditional Spring
for most new applications due to its simplified approach to development.
Below is detailed comparison:

1.  Auto - Configuration:
  Spring Boot:
  i. Automatically configures you application based on the dependencies
     you've added.
  ii. Reduce boilerplate configuration code significantly.
  iii. Intelligent defaults that can be overridden when needed.
  iv. No need for extensive XML configuration or annotation - based 
      configuration.

  Traditional Spring:
  i. Requires manual configuration for most components.
  ii. Developers must explicitly define beans, data sources,
      transaction managers, etc.
  iii. More prone to configuration errors.

2. Starter Dependencies:
  Spring Boot:
  i. Provides opinionated 'starter' dependencies
(e.g., spring-boot-starter-web,spring-boot-starter-data-jpa).
  ii. Each starter includes all necessary transitive dependencies with 
      compatible versions.
  iii. Simplifies dependency management and reduces version conflits.
