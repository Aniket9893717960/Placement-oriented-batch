Thread Safe Alternatives to "ArrayList" in Java especially focusing on
"CopyOnWriteArrayList" - in complete detail with easy to understand 
concept, real use - cases, and technical insight.

            THREAD SAFE ALTERNATIVES TO ARRAYLIST IN JAVA
Java provides several ways to make list based data structures safe for
multi threaded environments, where multiple threads read/write data
simultaneously.
Let's explore the 3 main thread safe alternatives to ArrayList:
       1. Vector (Legacy Thread Safe List)
   # What is It?
 *Vector is a synchronized version of "ArrayList".
 *All its methods are internally synchronized using synchronized keyword.
   Example:
    Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
    vector.add("One");
    vector.add("Two");

  #Drawbacks:
 *Synchronizes every operation, even reads -> causes performance issues.
 *Considered outdated for modern apps.
 *Replaced by more advanced options like "CopyOnWriteArrayList".

       2. Collections.synchronizedList()
   # What is it?
 *It's a wrapper around any list (like "ArrayList") that makes it 
   synchronized.
 *Provided by "java,util.Collections".
  Example:
List<String> syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
                   ----------NOTE----------
It makes all operations thread - safe, but:
  You must manually synchronize during iteration:
    PROGRAM
     synchronized(syncList){
     for (String s : syncList){
       System.out.println(s);
      }
     }
                   ----------X------------
   # Best For:
*Situations where u want to make an existing list thread safe quickly.
*Works better than "Vector" but require careful handling.

       3. CopyOnWriteArrayList (Modern & Efficient)
 *It is a thread safe version of "ArrayList" designed for concurrent 
  access, part of "java.util.concurrent".
 *Implements List Interface, so u can use it just like "ArrayList".

  # How it Works Internally:
 It uses the copy on write strategy:
  *Whenever u add, remove or modify the list, it creates a new copy
     of the entire underlying array.
  *The old array stays unchanged for readers.
This means readers never block or wait, and they get a stable snapshot of
the data.
Example:
   import java,util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
   public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args){
     CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
     //writer thread
     new Thread(() -> {
            list.add("Apple");
            list.add("Banana");
            list.add("Mango");
        }).start(); 
     //Reader Thread
     new Thread(() -> {
       for(String item : list){
         System.out.println("Reading: "+item);
       }
     }).start(); 
     }
   }
 This code will never throw ConcurrentModificationExceptio. Readers 
 always read a safe copy.

                     WHEN TO USE IT?
Use "CopyOnWriteArrayList" in multi threaded environments where:
 *Reads happen frequently
 *Writes happen occasionally
 *U want zero locking on road
                     REAL WORLD USE CASES:
 *Caching systems
 *Subscription lists (event listeners)
 *Configuration values
 *Real - Time dashboards or logs

                     PROS AND CONS
           Pros ✅	                        Cons ❌
   *Thread-safe reads          	High memory usage on 
   without locking                  write (copies array)
*No external synchronization 	Slow writes (copies the entire array)
   needed.
*Never throws           	Not good for write-heavy applications
 ConcurrentModificationException
*Safe to use in read-dominant	Not suitable for 
 scenarios                          real-time high-frequency edits

                   INTERNALS SUMMARY
*Backed by a volatile array.
*On write:
  Locks with ReentrantLock
  Creates a new array
  Performs the update
  Replaces the reference
*On read:
  No lock needed, returns a safe snapshot

             When Should You Use Which?
 Situation	                         Use This List Type
Single-threaded app	            ArrayList
Legacy synchronized list	Vector (only if forced)
Read-heavy + occasional writes	CopyOnWriteArrayList ✅
You already have a list to secure	Collections.synchronizedList
High write throughput required	ConcurrentLinkedQueue or other 
                                    concurrent data structures
