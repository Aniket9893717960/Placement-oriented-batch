we have to fetch the data but not with the help of 'ram' with the help of
something else 'brand' and from the 'brand' value of course we have to use 
single couts now because that's the string and of course u can use 'Like' 
as well.
For String or text it make sense to use 'Like' here i have to specify the brand
name as 'Asus' ok and we fetch this.
  This is the done code.
  Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like 'Asus'");
  List<laptop> = query.getResultList();

But what if u have this data in the string variable and u have storing that
data here 'Asus'. Now u have to pass this external data in this query.

Now if u are comming from the JDBC we will call the prepare statement.
In which u will pass the question mark u can done the same thing here 
u can put the question mark.
But the only difference is u have to also maintoined the no.
'q1','q2' so when u have the bigger query with multiple fields 
u want to insert and if you have multiple question mark some time

It's confusing to u as well that which question mark u are targeting and which
can lead bugs and errors So, SQL says it's very clear if u are saying Question 
mark And if you have multiple Question marks.
Give them a no. so, that when u replace them latter which no. you targeting.

Example in this case if you want to if u want to replace that '1'.
in this code
       Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like ?1");
I can say 
       query.setParameter(1,brand);
In which u have to specify the no. which u are replacing '1' with the
'brand'.
       Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like ?1 and ram=?2");
And u have to replace '2' as well.
Now here we don't have much data to filter
                       ------------NOTE-----------
If u are fetching only one data then 'String' will be more appropriate.
Code is given below.
         String brand = "Asus";
   Query query = session.createQuery("from Laptop where brand Like ?1");
   query.setParameter(1, brand);
   List<String> laptops = query.getResultList();

But if u want to take more than one data then u can only replace:
    List<String[]> laptops = query.getResultList();
                       --------------X-----------
After this line if you want to see the output.
    for(Object[] data : laptops){
              System.out.println((String)data[0] + " "+ (String)data[1]);
    }
TO see the fetched output.
