we are talking about the difference between Linklist and Arraylist.

       So first some similarities both are the part of List Interface. 
If u talk about collection API So, we have 
     List Interface ------> Set Interface
     Set Interface    |---> List Interface

Both are belongs to same family right but still there have some difference.
If u want to add data in the linked List and ArrayList the main use of this
' Want to add values as per Requirements.'

But for this use u also have a choice name 'Array' but what happen in array
is we have fixed size we don't go beyond the existing size which we already 
declare.

To Solve this Problem we Use Dynamic Array and to create a Dynamic Array we 
use 'ArrayList'.
    -----------
    Because u can add data in 'ArrayList' as per the requirments if u want to 
shrink the size u can also done that in 'ArrayList'. U can do all those stuff 
with arraylist right.


But the same thing is possible in 'LInkList' u can add elements and u can remove 
elements But the difference is in there implementation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Implementation
                    --------------
'ArrayList' will be build with the concept of Dynamic Array. While 
'Linked List' will be implementated with the concept of 'Double Linked List'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Dynamic Array
                -------------
How u store values in dynamic array:
      U have an Array in which Initial capacity will be 10.
If u add 5 element then u have capacity of 10 elements if u go 
beyond 10 element it will increase the size with 10 to 15 percent.

Initially it will be 10 but latter on it become 15 and later on it 
gone beyond that also
how will u store the dynamic array.
