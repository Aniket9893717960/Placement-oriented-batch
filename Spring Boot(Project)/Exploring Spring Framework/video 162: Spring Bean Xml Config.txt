Now we will solve the problem.
Is Basically we got the container And from the container i say 'getBean'
It should give me an object But if we see an error name 
"BeanFactory not initialized or already closed" But if u see which line 
getting the Error. 
  
Is it line no. '9' or '10' So, it's '10' So, it'snot actaully wrong with
line no. 9 which means we are able to get the container that's not the 
problem.

The problem is This 'Container' not able to find this 'Alien'.
So, how do we do that Is we talk to our spring framework by saying
it's your responsibility to manage this 'Alien' class.

Or to create an object of it And to talk with spring there are multiple 
ways which i talk before
  i. XML
  ii. Java Based Config
  iii. Annotations.
