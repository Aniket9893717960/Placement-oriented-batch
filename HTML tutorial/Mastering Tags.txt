 ----------NOTE -------------
<br> is a self closing tag that means we doesn't
required closing tag. This will be reperented with
two types of representation.
i)  <br>
ii) <br/>

H.W Question: Is we use multiple h1 tags or if don't then give 
              reason?
2) What is the difference between Ordered and Unordered List?
   -----------ALERT----------
this is not the difference that 'unordered list' will denoted by 
symbols and 'Ordered list' will denoted by no.
Because it's changable.

3) Try to create book marks on the website with the help of
Anchor tags?
   --------------------------
Answer) the 'main' difference b/w this two in 'Semintics'
In 'ordered list' if you are making the staps it will followed
like a sequence while in 'Unordered list' they are in raindom 
order.
So, the main difference in it's 'semantic' that's why it's called
semantic tag.
----------X------------------
Now we were come to 2nd video of the 
Strict and this time we gonna learn about 
"Mastering HTML tags for Development"

The fist thing we learn about
            'what is tags?'
The tag is a 'Markup Entity' or it's
a special word that provide the structure
, meaning, format our content.

tag is a thing which povide meaning to 
an image,a video,an audio,a paragraph,an article
and other things.

In tags we use three important words are:-
i) 'semantics' means meaning.
    ---------
ii) 'Structure' means organise.
    -----------
iii) 'Formatting' means arrange.
     ------------

Throw this words we provide categories of tags which
belong to this three components.

i) Semantics: <h1> : heading tag
   ---------  <p> : Paragraph tag
              <ul> and <ol> : unordered Ordered list
              <a> : anchor tag.
              <table>
              <tr> and <td>
              <img>
              <form>
              <input>
ii) Structure: <html>
    ---------  <head> <body>
              <header>
              <main>
              <aside>
              <footer>
              <article>
              <section>
              <nav> : navigation tag
iii) formationg: <b> : bold
     ----------  <i> : italic
              <u> : underline
              <strong> : strong
              <em> : emphasize
              <sup> : super script
              <sub> : sub script
              <pre> : presentation
              <code>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First we start with Semantic Tags
                    -------------
i) <h1> : means 'Heading' so let's say if u try to create an
          heading on your web page so, this will done with the
          help of heading tag.
          This will have different levels based on importance we labeled it:
          <h1> > <h2> > <h3> > <h4> > <h5>.
If u try to use wrong tags like '<h7>' and '<h8>' so,
it will works like a (paragraph tag)'<p>'.It will not
give Error.

ii) <a> : it's 'Anchor' tag. If u try to hyperlinks or try to
attach a pre deployed links to your web site, Just like
if you want to switch from one to another website or 
try to send email so, this whole thing is possible by 
'Anchor' tag.
     Use : a) switching from one to another
    ------    webpage.
            b) trying to send mail.
            c) trying to call.
At 'Anchor' tag we use 1 attribute name 'href'.for
if the person will click on this link then it will
redirect through those link.

iii) <ul> : 'Unordred list' tag. This is used for
            creating an 'Unordred list'.
But if u try to add some element in this 'Unordred list'
u have to use another tag simultaniously name
'li' tag.

$ <li> tag : 'List Items' tag. mainly use to add list 
             Items.
This two will used simultaniously as:
     "<ul>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
     </ul>"

iv) <table> : This will use to create tables
              But if u try to add some element in this 'Table'
u have to use another tag simultaniously name
'<tr>'(Table Row) and '<td>'(table column)

If you initially create 'table' with 'tr' and 'td' u
see that it's border are not visible.

v) <img> : 'Image' tag. In this we are using two
attributes are.
i) src : source location of the image.
ii) alt: 'alternative' it used when our 'src'
doesn't work.

vi) <p> : 'paragraph' tag. is used to write
          a group of text called Paragraph.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we start with Formatting Tags
                  ---------------
i) <b> : if you try to print some words and characters in the 
         Bold formating.
But there is a Question come in your mind that Why we are doing this 
With HTML why we doesn't done same thing with CSS?
        Yes, U are right this was used vary rearly because all the
Styling part will done in CSS.So, instead of that we use '<strong>'
Why?
Because it will done the same thing as '<b>' Promissing.But we got
Extra advantege that 'If our content will go from text to speech
so, Those word('ipsum' in our case) will be more important in the whole 
paragraph.'

ii) <i> : if you try to print some words and characters in the 
         Italic formating.
But there is a Question come in your mind that Why we are doing this 
With HTML why we doesn't done same thing with CSS?
        Yes, U are right this was used vary rearly because all the
Styling part will done in CSS.So, instead of that we use '<em>'(emphasize)
Why?
Because it will done the same thing as '<i>' Promissing.But we got
Extra advantege that 'If our content will go from text to speech
so, Those word('ipsum' in our case) will be more important in the whole 
paragraph.'

iii) <s> : 'Strike' tag.Use '<s>' tag to mark up text 
that is no longer correct.

iv) <sup> and <sub> : '<sup>' is super tag where 
                     It will try to show power up.
Example : 2^5
'sub' will try to show this at denominator.
Example : H2O

v) <br> : 'break line' tag.
