Now that we have learned how to create an 'object' in Javascript,
we should also learn how to access data from an object.
To access the value of a particular key in an object, we typically
use two notations :
                       i.  Dot Notations
                      -------------------
In Javascript is a way to access properties or methods of an object using
a dot(.) followed by the property or method name.
Example : Find create an object person with name and age as it's properties
          and a message as it's method.
                   const person = {
                   name = 'Mayank',
                   age = 21,
                   message : function() {
                   console.log('Helloooooooooo!');
                   }
                  };
         let myName = person.name;           // Mayank
         let myAge = person.age;           // 21
         let message = person.message();        // Hellooooo!
