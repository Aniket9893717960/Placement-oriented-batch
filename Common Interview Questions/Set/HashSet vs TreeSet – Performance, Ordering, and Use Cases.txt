                         WHAT IS HASHSET?
HashSet is a class in Java that belongs to the Collection Framework and 
implements the Set Interface. It is used to store unique elements only
- meaning no duplicates are Allowed.
Internally, HashSet is backed by a HashMap. Even through u use a Set, 
it actually puts data inside a HashMap behind the scenes.

   # Key Properties Of HashSet:
i. If u try to add a duplicate value, it will not be inserted.
ii. It does not maintain the order of insertion or sorting.
iii. U can insert one null element into a HashSet.
iv. On average, operations like add(), remove(), contains() are O(1).
v. Internally uses a hash table through a HashMap instance.

   #Internal Working Of HashSet: 
Here's how "HashSet" works step by step:
 1. When u add an element to a "HashSet", like "set.add("Apple")", it is 
    actually calling "map.put("Apple", PRESENT)" in the background.
 2. The value "Apple" is used as the key in the internal "HashMap", and
    a constant dummy value is used as the value.
 3. The object's hashCode() method determines where to store the value in
    the hash table (bucket).
 4. It two objects have the same hash code,
