Now let's talk about 'collection'. The funny thing is 
in this topic we have three Different Type of collection.

The first we have 'collection APT'

The second one is collection

The last one is collections

This is the most confusing thing in this.
When we are talking about 'collection API'
then we talk about 'concept'.
So, let's say 'Hey we talk about someting
at collection API'.It's something which belongs
to this concept.

If we start with collection then we talk about
'Interface'.If i say collection i was talking 
about the 'Interfaces and some classes who
implement this'.

At last In 'Collections' we talk about 'class'.
And then, we talk about collections which is a
class or that have multiple methods to work with.

Ok so why we will talk about collection here then

say if you have one value then u can store it in one 
variable Just like 
         'int num =5;' but what if you have multiple 
values and that's the problem creates How will u 
store multiple values and i know u know the answer.

The answer is 'ARRAY' and u want to work with
