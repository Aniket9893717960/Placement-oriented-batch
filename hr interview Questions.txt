                              TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF
Hello, my name is Aniket Rathore, and I am from Indore, the cleanest
city in India for the past seven years.

I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with 
a specialization in Big Data Analytics in collaboration
with IBM from Shri Vaishnav Institute of Information Technology.

I completed my Higher Secondary Education from Shri RK Daga Maheshwari Academy with 61.8% and my Senior Secondary 

Education from Shri Vaishnav Academy with 60%. In JEE Mains, I secured 
55.56 percentile.

I have a strong technical background in C, C++, Java, Full Stack Java 
Development, and DBMS. I also worked on 
an innovative project called 'Online Voting System,' a web-based Java 
application designed to modernize traditional voting methods. 
I led this project from start to finish, handling both technical 
development and project management.

I am a dedicated learner and problem solver who enjoys taking on 
challenges. 
My hobbies include playing chess and reading books, which help me 
improve my strategic thinking and analytical skills.

With my technical skills, project experience, and problem-solving 
approach, I am eager to contribute to your organization and grow as a 
professional.

Thank you!

                        WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU
You should consider hiring me because I bring a well-rounded combination 
of technical proficiency which I think most of the students done 
firstly. But I have actively 
participated in events like The model United Nations(MUN) at SVVV and 
IIT Indore
which have helped me develop confidence, public speaking skills and 
ability to present 
ideas clearly and persuasively.
Additionally, my internship experience and participation in coding 
challenges have
made me comfortable working under deadlines, both independently and as 
part of a team.
I believe my balanced skill set, along with a strong work ethic and 
eagerness to contribute meaningfully, makes me a valuable fit for
your organization.

                   WHAT's YOUR GREATEST STRENGTHS?
One of my greatest strengths is my adaptability. I thrive in dynamic work
environments and have consistently demonstrated the ability to learn new
technologies quickly.
For example, at my previous internship, I was asked to work on web 
scrapping module that I had never worked with before.I immersed myself 
in  learning it and successfully delivered the project on time.

                    What's Your greatest weakness?
I used to struggle with delegating tasks, often taking on too much 
myself. However, I recorgnized this as a weakness and actively worked 
on improving my delegation skills. I now understand the importance of
empowering team members and have seen how it enhances both productivity
and team morale.

   CAN YOU DESCRIBE A CHALLENGING SITUATIONS YOU FACED AT WORK AND
                         HOW YOU HANDLED IT?
As u know we build different projects(like Minor And Major) in which
some cases we faced a tight deadline issue to complete a project with
high degree and complexity.The team was under immense pressure and 
conflicts started to arise. 
At that time we took and initiative to organize a team meeting. when
we onely discussed our concerns and brainstormed solutions. 
By fostering open communication and reassigning tasks based on team
members strengths, we not only met the deadline but also improved team
dynamics.

              WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSLF IN 5 YEARS?
In my 5 years i see my self in a leadership role within the company,
possibly in a IT Lead, Senior Developer position.
I would like to leverage my experience to mentor and lead teams to 
success while contibuting to company's long term goals.

   TELL ME ABOUT A TIME YOU FAILED AND WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM IT?
