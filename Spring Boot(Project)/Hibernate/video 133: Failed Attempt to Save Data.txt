Now first we create those classes So, what i want to achieve here is:
 i. First we have to delete the 'org' package.
 ii. second we have to create the class name 'Student.java' file in 'com.telusko'
   Package.
 iii. So, in this 'Student' package what are the things we need
                                                        Private int rollNo;
Go for the first column as 'rollNo' or variable as 'rollNo'.
Now i will go with the Name.
                            Private String sName;
At last i will go with the age.
                            Private String age;
So, we got 3 fields Now with this fileds we will create the getter's and Setter's

  iv. right click then click on 'Generate' then click on 'Getter's and Setters's'
      And we select all 3 variables then click 'OK'.
  v. And Now we want 'toString()' method to print it. 
     So, right click. click on 'generate' then 'toString' and we select all 3 
     variables then click 'OK'.

So, simple stuff nothing fancy we got pojo which is 'Student' here And this is what we
are going to work with 'ok' So, Now in Step 6.

  vi. In the 'main' class we will try to create the object of class name 'Student'
      's1' with the keyword 'new'.
                     Student s1 = new Student();
Now we will add some data because if i try to print this object currently it will
print something
              " Student(rollNo, sName='null', sAge=0) "

  vii. Now we will add some data then we print it with the help of 
                 s1.setsName("Navin");
                 s1.setRollNo(101);
                 s1.setsAge(30);

Now with this details if we try to print it we got the data.
              " Student(rollNo=101, sName="Navin", sAge=101) "
But i not aimed to print this data. The aim is to store the data in database
So, which database i was talking about.
