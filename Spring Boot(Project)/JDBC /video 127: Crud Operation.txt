So, we were able to get the data right 
1st we fetch the single data we are not
sure how many data's we have  and we have 3 columns
which u going to fetch now of course u automate

But what about Inserting the data is it realy possible of course
right when u are connecting your application with database and the
user may want to add so many recourds.

So, there is something called CRUD operation which is 
    Create    Read      Update      Delete
so, we were able to read so, the our part is done but what about 
the Create Read and Delete.
What will remain common is the Establishment in connection
because after that things will start changing so, u need the
current statement as well.
                  'Statement st = con.createStatement()'
Things will change from here so, what ever we do is we change the part from here
because that something we want to change so, first we drive the SQL Query here

    String sql = "insert into student values (5, 'John', 48)";

So, how do you execute so, ofcourse we got the 'Statament'
now we have to chose method the thing is at first we have 'executeQuery'

But 'executeQuery' make sense when we want to get data.
because it returns 'resultset' this time we use to execute the query
which will return something else so, we have something called 
'execute' here then, we just pass the query which is 'sql'
what it will do is it will execute the query.

Now what it returns if we click on 'execute' will returns the 
'boolean' value u will execute the data or not that's what we
get here

            boolean status = st.execute(sql);

So, what we can do is we get the variable called 'boolean' name
'status' so, in this we will say 'true' or 'false' so,
first of all print the 'status' then once u exeute that we should be
there in database right.

'execute' will return different type of data. It can return the resultSet
if it will be the Sql query or 'select' query it will return the count
if you insert the update query.
If let me say if you want to update some data so, of course we have to 
maintoined how many rows we are updated So, it returns 'false' when
u are executing insert update query.

Insert is working let we done the update
                  For Update we use the Query is
    'String sql = "update student set sname= 'Max' where sid=5"'

Same as the 'Delete' Query :
          String sql = "delete from student where sid=5";
