Start SQL O Sorry we are continuing 'Hibernate' So, 
HQL which stands for 'Hibernate Query Language' SO,
when u work with database. Or if u want to work with DBMS like
ORACLE, MySQL, POSTgreSQL or bunch of them.
       Normally to interact with them we use the something called
'SQl' which stands for 'Structured Query Language' Now using this 
language u can done the 'CRUD' Operations.

With the database or with the Data which u have
'Create        Read      Update      Delete'
                |- Select Query.

If u say u want to read we normally fire the 'select' query
with the 'select' query U can filter the elements with the 
help of 'Where' clause.
U can join two tables.
U can apply filter on them with the help of 'GROUP BY'.

There are allot of thing which u can do when u have this 
'Relational Database Management System' this is the beauty about 
it.
it's very efficient and it's amazing  and for doing that u need to 
learn 'SQL' and u have to master it when u want to be more efficient 
in Database Communication.
