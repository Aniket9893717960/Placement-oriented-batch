Now in this video we talk about 2 different annotation.
1. is 'Scope'.
2. Is 'Value'.
                      SCOPE
Remember we have talk about different 'scope' 1st is 'SingleTon'
And 'Prototype' If u want to use 'SingleTon' prototype then u 
can maintoined that with the help of '@Scope' Annotation
when we are getting a bean in 'Java Based CONFIGURATION'.

Now we guess when actually we do that of course in the class.
So, just maintoined the 'scope' annotation And in bracket u maintoined
Which scope u want may be u can maintoined 'prototype' At top of 'Desktop'.
CODE
    @Component
    @Primary
    @Scope("Prototype")
    public class Desktop implements Computer {}

If u want to change the annotation then u will use '@Scope' annotation
Let's solve the next problem. If u run this program then look at 
the value which is '0'.

We don't want '0' we want the value remember we have 'AppConfig' when
we assign some value to the 'age' we not doing it now that's why default 
value is '0'.

But what if we want to change it we can assign the value of 'age' at
'Alien' but some times we want to inject this value from some other 
property files.
How we can inject it not with the object but with value. In that case
we have to use another annotation which is 'value' in which u can 
maintoined '21'.

Now u can say what's the difference between assigning the value like 
'@value' why we not assign the value 'Directly' like 
"Private int age=21;".
Because we were hard codeing in it basically u can inject this value 
from outside the code. May be u have the property file in which u have
all the values.

Again how we can do that  it's a different thing but there is a option
when u can inject the value. if we run the program now we got value
'21'. So, that's how we use the 'scope' annotation and 'value' 
annotation.

FINAL CODE IS :
               1. 'AppConfig.java' program
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.telusko")
public class AppConfig {}
               2. 'Alien.java' program
@Component
public class Alien {
	@Value("21")
	private int age;
	
	private Computer com;
	
	public Alien() {
		System.out.println("Alien Object Created");
	}

  public int getAge() {
	return age;
	}
	
	public void setAge(int age) {    // Setter Injection
		//System.out.println("Setter called");
		this.age = age;
	}
	
	public Computer getCom() {
		return com;
	}	
	
	@Autowired
@Qualifier("laptop")
	public void setCom(Computer com) {
		this.com = com;
	}
	
	public void code() {
		System.out.println("Coding");
		com.compile();
	}
}
         3. 'App.java' program
public class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

		Alien obj1 = context.getBean(Alien.class);
	   System.out.println(obj1.getAge());
		obj1.code();
}
          4. 'Computer.java' program
package com.telusko;

public interface Computer {

	void compile();
}
         5. 'Desktop.java' program
@Component
@Primary
@Scope("prototype")
public class Desktop implements Computer {

	public  Desktop() {
		System.out.println("Desktop  Object Created");
	}
	@Override
	public void compile() {
		System.out.println("Compiling using Desktop");
	}
}
          6. 'Laptop.java' program
@Component
public class Laptop implements Computer{
	public Laptop() {
	System.out.println("Laptop object created");
}
	
	@Override
	public void compile()
	{
		System.out.println("Compiling using Laptop");
	}
	
}
