        H.W
 Symbol Datatype You have to studies.
--------------------NOTE------------
When adding a number and a string,
JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
Example :-
         let x = 16 + "Aniket";
------------------------------------
In this we have here the name that 
we will talk about 'type of data'
(like 'String','Integer' and etc)

This are like an 
"'Entity Which represent which type of data we were trying to talk about
& What is the size of data'"
This datatypes have Two types:
i. Non Premitive Datatype(Talk about it in some Other lecture)
                        Premitive Data Types
                        --------------------
It's the first type of an Datatype which we are talking about
throw out the lecture.
JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable
can be used to hold different data types:
i. String
   ------  (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
        Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
Example :
// Using double quotes:         // Using single quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";       let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';

ii. Numbers
    -------  All JavaScript numbers are stored 
            as decimal numbers (floating point).
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

The Range of Numbers will be between
      -(2^53-1) -> (2^53+1)
Example :
// With decimals:           // Without decimals:
let x1 = 34.00;               let x2 = 34;

iii. Undefined
     --------- In JavaScript, a variable without a value,
has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
Example :
         let car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
         console.log(car);

iv typeOf
   ------  You can use the JavaScript typeof operator 
to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:
Example :
          typeof 0              // Returns "number"
          typeof 314            // Returns "number"
          typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
          typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
          typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number"

v. Boolean
   -------- Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
Example :
         let x = 5;
         let y = 5;
         let z = 6;
         (x == y)       // Returns true
         (x == z)       // Returns false

vi. BigInt
    ------  All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.
JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store 
integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
Example :
       let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");

vii. Null
     ---- `null` indicates the deliberate absence of any object value. It’s a 
primitive value that denotes the absence of a value or serves as a placeholder for
an object that isn’t present.
Example :
        let number = null;
        console.log("Type of number is:" ,typeof number);

viii. Symbol
      -------
     U have to study it by your self.
