Till this point we talk about the 'xml Configuration' and we have used 
'java based Configuration' as well. In which we have talk about 
multiple annotation like
 @Configuration  @Bean   @Primary
And with this things are working out. So, we are quite happy
So, the main question is are We?
So, the thing is when we say that spring will make your work easy 
Then we expect that 'Spring' will done things automatically.

Specially when we started with 'spring boot'. And we got to know 
that spring boot will make your work very easy. 
In spring as well without using spring boot. we get that easy part
But looking at the configuration we are not that happy.

Even if it's your 'XML COnfiguration' or your "java based Configuration".
We need to create the object below by self and inject them.
  Alien obj = new Alien();
  obj.setAge(25);
  obj.setCom(com);
  return obj;
We make to build this more easy. Now we have some more annotation which
we have used they are your "sterotype" annotation. when u talk to your
spring framework with the class metadata itself. 
So, u can maintoined in your class.
"Hey u know spring u are responsible to manage this bean".
What we mean by that is if u look at this 'Alien','Desktop' 
And 'laptop'.

U have No idea that we are using a spring framework.
And we ask to your 'Alien' class. u have to know that u have used by
spring 'Alien' itself.
Hey we doesn't have any idea because 
"No one in this file will actually want to use spring".

Look at this 'Desktop' they have no idea that they are the part of 
'Spring' Project. But what we can tail them.
hey u know u are the part of spring project. The way u can do that by 
Just GO to top of Any class let's say 'Alien'.
We write 'Component'.
