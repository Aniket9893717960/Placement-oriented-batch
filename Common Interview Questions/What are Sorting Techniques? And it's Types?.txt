Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format - either ascending
or descending order. In java, sorting helps in optimizing search
operations, reporting and organizing data efficiently.

  Types of Sorting Techniques
  ---------------------------
Sorting can be broadly categorized into:
1. Internal Sorting
        Performed when the data fits entirely into memory.
2. External Sorting
        Used when data is too large to fit into memory.
