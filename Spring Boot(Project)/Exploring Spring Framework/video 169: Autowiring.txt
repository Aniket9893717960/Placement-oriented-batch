So, we have done with the interface creation right.
We got one interface and we got one implementation but 
will this code work.
because we doesn't run the code in last video 
Now if we run the program we got error. This error will look 
interesting let's see what the error is 
"It cannot resolve the matching constructor"
Ok we are still dependent on constructor. what we will do is we go 
to the property one So, let me comment in 'spring.xml' file 
below section.
          <constructor-arg name="lap" ref="lap1" />
          <constructor-arg name="age" ref="21" />

And let's work with 'property' here.
          <property name="age" ref="21" />
          <property name="lap" ref="lap1" />
And then we got the 'Laptop' now the 'Alien' is basically even it will
not work because "we are looking for 'Computer' And what u got is 
'Laptop'"
In technical words:
 Invalid Property 'lap' of bean class [com.telusko.Alien]:
   Bean property 'lap' is not writable or has an invalid setter.

SO, we don't have lap any more but what we have which is 'Computer'
'com' SO, now what we are doing is 'com' which will refer the 'lap1'
          <property name="age" ref="21" />
          <property name="com" ref="lap1" />

Ok we can done few more changes what will do is we go back to 'Alien'
and comment certain things. I don't want to print this
