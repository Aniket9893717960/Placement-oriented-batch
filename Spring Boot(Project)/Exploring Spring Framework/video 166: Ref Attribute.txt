Now we know how to inject the property.
  The property which u are working with is a normal variable or
'Primitive' Variable. But what if  the property will not want to primitive
variable It's a 'Reference' let's example say go back to 'laptop'.

U normally do is u write code. U want this to work u want to get the 
output. u got the problem when u solve the problem. when u got to in your
brain also if u want to get the output or computing when the laptop there.

And then in your laptop u need a compiler. Let's say we have the method
name 'compile' in class 'Laptop' then u want to print 'Compiling'.

Now in 'Alien' we got the 'code' of course after coding we got the compile
method And if u want to call the method 'compile' u have to basically create
the object of laptop.Because u can't call 'compile' directly
