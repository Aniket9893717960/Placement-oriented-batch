           1. What are Variables?Why Do we need Them?
 i. The Concept:
 Think Of variables as labeled jars u use in science class. Want to 
 store water? U grab a jar and write "Water" on it! In programming,
 a variable is a container for storing information-numbers,words or 
 anything else.

 ii. Why Variables Exist in Dart:
 *Dart needs a way to remember things: scores in a game, a user's name, etc.
 *Using labeled variables makes code readable-so any programmer instantly
 knows what is being stored.

           2. Why Does Dart Have Date Types? The Story Behing 
                             "Type Safety"
 i. What are Data Types?
 Every jar(variables) can only safety hold certain stuff. Dart has types like:
 *int(whole numbers)
 *double(decimal numbers)
 *String (text)
 *bool (true/false)
 *List: a list of items ()
 *Map: key/value pairs ({'name':'Amit','age':20})

 ii. Why Strong Data Types in Dart?
 *Helps U catch mistakes early. Try adding a number to text 
  (like 10 +"Hello") - Dart will warn u instead of waiting until u app
  crashes for users.
 *Makes code easier to read and maintain - others can see what goes 
  inside each variable.
 *Allows Dart to run code faster because  it doesn't have to guess what 
  u mean.
              3. How to Declare Types in Dart?
  There are two ways to declare variables:
  *Explicitly:
     dartCODE:
      int age = 20;
      String name = 'Amit';
      Implicitly (with var):
     dartCODE:
      var age = 20;         // Dart sees this is int
      var name = 'Amit';    // Dart sees this is String
  
  Why allow both?: This makes code faster to write but still safe.
                   if u want Dart to figure it out for u, use var.
  if u want stictness, specify the type.

            4. Mutable vs Immutable
 *var and dynamic: contents can change.
    dartCode:
     var score = 5;
     score = 7;        //Okay!

 *final: assign once, can't change later.
    dartCode:
      final pi = 3.1415;
      pi = 3.14;     // error!

 *const: assign at compile time, never changes.
    dartCode:
      const daysInWeek =7;
 *Why these options?
  Sometimes u need to save memory
