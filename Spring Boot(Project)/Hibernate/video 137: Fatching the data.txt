So, Now we have the data in database. The next thing we gonna do is
'fatch the data'. Now if you go back to your code.
U can see what we are doing in 'Main.java' file is we were adding 
the data in the student and we are trying to save it.

We don't want to save it we want to fatch it and to do that 
what we do is first of all i want to create an object of 'Student'.

           Student s2 = new Student();
But we want to keep it                  "Student s2 = null"
at this point And instead of printing 's1' we print 's2'.
And we just commit the 'session.persist()' part.
                        -----------------  If u see it printing 'null'.

Because we are just assinging the 'null' in 's2' and we are printing 'null' 
In between this two Operations we want to fatch the value.

So, before we moving on first we have to know that is there any requirment 
of 'Transaction'.
here talking about                                                 operation
                Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();

Now in this scenario since there is no other dependency we can remove the 
transaction because when u were fatching data u don't need 'Transaction'
object To begin the transaction.
It's only when u were doing some manipulation in database So, i got the 
'SessionFactory' object we got the 'Session' object and we are closing it here

In between we can fatch the value Now how do u fatch it SO, let's try to see at
the 'session' and let's see what methods we have
So, 
    Save and Presist: for saving.
And u can see the one particular mathod which is 'byId' this will have the
return type 'IdentifierLoadAccess' I simply want an object 
So, i just go down and see the method which will give u the object itself


So, yes we now got this 'get' method which will take String and Object as a
parameter and return the object.
This make sense right SO, in this method we pass to this are as follows:
