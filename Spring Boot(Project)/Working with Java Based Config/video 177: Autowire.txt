Let we work with 'Alien' object as well. we worked with 'Desktop'
now we create 'bean' for the laptop. So, what we wanna do is 
the same thing what i can done before
In 'App.java' when we configure the 'spring.xml'.
We write the below things:
  Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien1",Alien.class);
    obj1.setAge(21);
    System.out.println(obj1.getAge());
    obj1.code();

but we change this thing.
      For working with "Java Based Config".
1. At "Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien1",Alien.class);"
  we just not maintoined the name we just work with 'Alien.class'.
Same we are just setting the age. then we are saying 'getAge'.
Then we call code.

2.We doesn't want to work with 'Desktop' any more so, we just 
remove below lines in 'App.java'.
CODE:
    Desktop dt = context.getBean(Desktop.class);
    dt.compile();
    Desktop dt1 = context.getBean(Desktop.class);
    dt.compile();
