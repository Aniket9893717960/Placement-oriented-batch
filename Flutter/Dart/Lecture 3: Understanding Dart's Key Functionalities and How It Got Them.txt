In this lec, we will explore important unique features of Dart, why they 
exist, and how Dart's design choices help solve common programming challenges.
We'll keep everything simple and fun!

1. Just In Time(JIT) And Ahead-Of-Time(AOT) Compilation: Why So much Speed?
i. What are JIT and AOT?
 *JIT(Just-In-Time) Compilation is like a magic cook who reads the recipe 
  and prepares the dish while guests are arriving. It allows u to test and 
  change code quickly.
 *AOT(Ahead Of Time) Compilation is like preparing all dishes before the 
  guests arrive, so food is ready immediately when served.

ii. Why Does Dart Use Both?
 *During development, Dart uses JIT so programmers can quiclky test
  and see changes without waiting a long time. This is called "hot reload".
 *For the final app users, Dart uses AOT to convert code into super fast 
  native machine code that runs lightning fast on phones or computers.

 Reason:
 This hybrid approach balances developer productivity (fast testing) and
 app performance (fast user experience), making Dart apps both easy to 
 build and fast to run.

2. Null Safety: The Shield Against Crashes
 i.More on Null Safety: 
  ------- In programming,"null" is like an empty box, and if u try to 
          open it without checking, your program crashes.
Dart added sound null safety to ensure you explicitly say whether a 
variable can be empty or not. if u say "no empties allowed," 
Dart enforces that rule strictly.

 ii. How Did Dart get this feature?
 Before sound null safety, many languages had bugs and crashes due to
 unexpected null values.

 Reason: To make apps more reliable and reduce annoying bugs, Dart's
         team designed null safety to catch null related errors during
 development rather than when users see them.

3. Sound type System: Precision in Code
  i. What is a Sound type System?
  ---- It means Dart checks the types of variables and objects vary 
  strictly to catch errors early. if something is told to be an integer,
  It cannot suddenly become a string unknowingly.

 ii. Why is it important?
 ----- Early type checking prevents many errors before running the code,
 saving time and avoiding surprises.

 iii. How Did Dart Achieve This?
 ----------- Dart uses static typing with inference - meaning u can be 
 explicit with types or let Dart guess safety.

 Reason: It balances safety with convenience, so developers write fewer
         but don't need to be overly strict all the time.

 4. Hot Reload: fast Feedback for Developers
