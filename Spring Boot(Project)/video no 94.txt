In this video we will talk about 'Threads'.
Now what are 'Threads' thing about it
when u run the application of course to the 
software which we have return on the OS.

And OS have the layer which is called 'Hardware'.
So, if you want to represent this what we normally
has 

if the Software
       ________ 
runs on    |
      Operating System
down  -----------------
there we have       |
physical set      Hardware(like CPU,RAM)
                  ----------------------
This are the things we have to use Running the Application

If we talk about 'RAM' so, 'RAM' will Act like a temproray memory.
where will your Processing.

CPU is something where u Exceute things OK so, let's say in your
software.

It will work on one or two software but if you think that u have 
work upon multiple software. So, i was saying that OS should support 
multiple software at the same time.
Condition : we running multiple task at the same time. Most of the
morder OS support that the thing is they are not Exceuting the task
Simultaniously.

Just like we have the software 1,2,3 will trying to run at the same 
time SO, in concept 'Time Sharing' at which thay will shedules the
time slots at which software 1,2,3 one by obe simultaniously Excutes.

That's one thing or with this we have to achieve multiple tasks.

It's not just about Multi- Tasking. It just about dividing your task into
multiple small things the smallest unit so, how can we do that
SO, that's where we have the concept called 'Threads'.

'Threads' are simply a smallest unit which u have to work with.
