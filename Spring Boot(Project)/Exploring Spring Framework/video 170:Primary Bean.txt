Ok so now we solve this problem Because know if we run this
If we run the code before It was giving u an error
"It found Two(com1, com2) expected was only one"
To solve this we can something for Primary.
Example:
       let's say u have an application where u have the
database connection for some time in a backup u have different 
connection. which was running 
 i. one is primary one.
 ii. one is the backup

By default "Of course we have 2 options" but we make one as primary
one for example i say when u go by type and u have 2 options here 
We can say below is primary.
  <bean id="com1" class="com.telusko.Laptop" primary="true"></bean>
         it says in case of 'laptop' and 'Desktop' where spring is 
not able to deside which one we select "PRIMARY" will say 
 'select 'laptop' first'.
So, 'Primary' will prefer when he build the sort of confusion
What if you are explicitly maintoin we are going to access 
'com2'.
        <property name="com" ref="com2"/>
Even if you have the byte type which says 'PRIMARY' is 'laptop'
if you have maintoined explicitly it will goes for 'Desktop'.
So, 'PRIMARY' works only when u have the confusion If you define 
explicitly in 'Property' it will go for that Even if u say 
'AUTOTYPE byName' it will search by 'name'.
'AUTOTYPE byType' it will maintoined explicitly below one
   If he have sort of confusion it will go for 'PRIMARY' type.
