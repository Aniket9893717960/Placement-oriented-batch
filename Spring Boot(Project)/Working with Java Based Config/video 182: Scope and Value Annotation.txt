Now in this video we talk about 2 different annotation.
1. is 'Scope'.
2. Is 'Value'.
                      SCOPE
Remember we have talk about different 'scope' 1st is 'SingleTon'
And 'Prototype' If u want to use 'SingleTon' prototype then u 
can maintoined that with the help of '@Scope' Annotation
when we are getting a bean.
