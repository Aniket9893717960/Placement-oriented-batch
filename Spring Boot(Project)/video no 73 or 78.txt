In the previous 3 videos we are talking about:
i) Abstract class
2) Anonymous Inner class
3) inner class
so, we want to implement this 3 concepts in one program.
will be implemented ðŸ‘‡



make a Problem that we want to access an abstract class by just building a object.
because we got error like "Cannot instantiate the type A" 
The solution to solve this problem is create another class which extends the abstract 
class at those class write the defination of abstract class inner method and u sow 
an override sign at just above the defination will be auto generated.
this will be implemented in this program.

abstract class A
{
 public abstract void show();
}

class B extends A {
 public void show(){
   // TODO Auto-generated method stub
   System.out.println("In B show");
 }
}

public class Demo
{
 public static void main(String args[]){
 A a = new B();
 a.show();
 }
}




But why are u creating class 'B' if u will use this only one time so why u don't
use 'Anonymous Inner class'.

abstract class A
{
 public abstract void show();
 public abstract void config();
}
public class Demo
{
 public static void main(String args[]){
 A a = new A()
 {
  public void show(){
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    System.out.println("In new show");
  }

  public void config(){
    System.out.println("In config");
  }
 };
 a.show();
 }
}
