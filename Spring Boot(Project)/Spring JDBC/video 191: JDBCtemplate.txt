Let's add JDBC template just because we want to store this data in database.
See the thing is when a moment u add your 'H2' in your dependency, basically
you get the H2 database and also the driver for it.

So, it's time to use it and by default, it will have some default values
and you don't have to actually configure anything. By default u get the 
configuration. You just have to use the template to save data.

Of course u want to customize it that's a different thing. But by default you
will get the values. So, what i will do here is, first of all, let me take
"Console" to right top. I want my output to be here.

So, what i will do is first of all 'Add the Student'? Now for this, we need
JDBC template. So, what i will do is, I will just go back to"SpringRapo" 
and say 'private' and let's create a reference for "JDBCtemplate" and
we'll say this name as jdbc itself.
CODE:
     private JdbcTemplate jdbc;

U have different name as well Doesn't matter,but let's use jdbc here. And now for this particular variable we need to have getters and setters.
CODE:
    public JdbcTemplate getJdbc() {
        return jdbc;
    }

    public void setJdbc(JdbcTemplate jdbc) {
        this.jdbc = jdbc;
    }
