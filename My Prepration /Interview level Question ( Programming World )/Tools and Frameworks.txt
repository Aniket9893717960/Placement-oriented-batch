                           Question 1:
          Which IDE did you use for development during your internship 
          (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse)?
                       Answer:
              I used NetBeans 8.2 for development during my internship.

                          Question 2:
          Did you work with any build tools or frameworks (like Maven or Spring)? 
           answer briefly because u know about me?
                      Answer:
          No, I didn’t use Maven — and I haven’t worked with Spring yet.

                       Question 3:
          How did you manage your codebase? Did you use version control (e.g., Git)?
                Answer:
          During my internship, I didn’t use version control like Git — 
          I managed my codebase directly in NetBeans.
