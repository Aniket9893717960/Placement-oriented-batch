Understanding the difference b/w Spring and struts framework is important
for Java Developers, as both frameworks serve distinct purpose in building 
web applications. The main difference lies in their design and functionality.

 Spring: Spring is a comprehensive, modular framework offering dependency
         Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming and extensive integration
         capabilities for enterprise application.
 Struts: Struts is an action based MVC framework primarily focused on 
         web applications, with less flexibility and integration compared 
         to spring.

                  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPRING AND STRUTS
The table below demonstrate the difference b/w Spring and Struts.
