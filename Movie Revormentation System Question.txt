                 What was the project about?
I developed a "Movie Recommendation System With Web Scrapping"
during my internship at Allsoft Solutions. It leveraged web Scraping
to gather real-time movie data(like genres, rating and reviews) from
sources like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.
The system used "content-based filtering"(and optionally collaborative
filtering) to suggest personalized movies to users based on their 
preferences.
The backend was built in Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit
-learn, and Flask for deployment.

                How did you collect data?
I scraped data using Python libraries like BeautifulScoup/Scrapy
from movie databases(e.g., IMDB). Key Features extracted included:
 Title, Genre, Director, Cast (for content based Filtering)
 User Rating/Reviews (for collaborative filtering if implemented)
 Poster Urls(for UI display)
 I cleaned and stored this data in a structured format (CSV/SQLite)
 for processing.
