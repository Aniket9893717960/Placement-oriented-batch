Now let's get our "HomePage" ready. Because when u go for the "HomePage".
It's says the below error.
"Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404)."

So, what we are requesting for if u see the address bar we are requesting for
"localhost:8080", which is your website and then when u request for the homepage,
It says '404'.

That means our home page is not there yet. And we know if u want to create a 
"view Technology". U can create a JSP page. Again this change dependes upon
  what u are using in the front end.

If u are using a 'React' application. Or if u are using, let's say a mobile
application, what u want is only a data. but then we'll see that later,
how do we just return data?

At this point a want to return a full fledge HTML page and we can design 
that with the help of JSP. So, i will go back to my IDE, and here let me 
create a homepage, but where u will do it?

So, u can just go to your main folder and inside this u can create your 
"index.jsp".
