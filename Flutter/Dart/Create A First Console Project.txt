        Creating first_application using template console...

          Changed 49 dependencies!

        Created project first_application in first_application! In order to get started, run the following commands:
          cd first_application
          dart run
        exit code 0

3. After Creation Of Our First Project First thing u See Is 3 diff folders.
   "bin","lib","test" 
 If we open "bin" we got 'firstprogram.dart' Code Is Given Below:
        import 'package:first_application/first_application.dart' as first_application;
        void main(List<String> arguments) {
            print('Hello world: ${first_application.calculate()}!');
        }

4. Now In 'lib' folder we created a our first program of 'dart' is given below:
    "void main(){
      print("Hello World");
    }"

5. Now to run this program we have to click on "RUN & DEBUG".
   We Got "Hello World" On Debug Console.
