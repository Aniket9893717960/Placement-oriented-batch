              1. Why Do We Need Packages And Libraries?
Imagune building a robot. u could start from scatch each time, but isn't
it smarter to use ready made wheels, sensors and chips someone else 
perfected? In programming, packages and libraries let developers share 
their best solutions- so u don't reinvent the wheel for for every project

                     Why Did Dart include them?
As apps grow, code gets complex. Dary's creators wanted a way to:
 *Divide programs into modules(organized chunks).
 *Reuse excellent Code Written by others.
 *Make large apps easier to build, fix, and upgrade.

             2. What is a Library? How Does Dart Use Them?
A library is a collection of related tools, types and functions like
a "toolbox". The Dart standard library includes helpers for math, text
, files, internet etc.
   i. How to use it? CODE:
 import 'dart:math';
 void main(){ print(sqrt(16)); // Uses math library! }

 ii. Why need imports? imports keep your code tidy - only tools u need 
 are loaded, boosting speed and clarity. Dart's libraries are carefully
 separated (math, async, io) for best organization.

          3. What is a Package? How Do Developers share Them?
A package in Dart is a bundle of code u can easily add to your own
project. There are open source packages for everything: animation,
networking, charts or connecting to databases.
 How to add? *Dart and Flutter projects use a 'pubspex.yaml' file to
              declare needed packages.
 *Packages are shared through pub.dev, Dart's official Library store.
 Sample:  
        dependencies: http: ^1.0.0
