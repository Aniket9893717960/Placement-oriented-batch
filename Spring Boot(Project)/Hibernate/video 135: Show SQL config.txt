Till  this point we were able to store the data in database And we are quite
happy with it. And if u look also this once agin so, this time what happends
if i try to run this one again.
But the row we were trying to insert is already have in the table.
If we re run the program than we got an error name
"duplicate key value violates unique constraint "student_pkey" "

the thing is if we go to student 'id' we decalared this as 'Primary Key'.
So, we are trying to save the same data.
And that's what the issue is So, this time i change the name, roll No and 
age is ("kiran", "102", "25") So, this are the values we have and if u run 
this of course it should work.

See behind the seen we know that 'Hibernate' is using the 'JDBC' And when u use 'JDBC'
Basically it will use Queries. So, u wanted to see what the query is so, u can do that
Just go to 'hibernate.cfg.xml'.
when we use property tag name 'hibernate.show_sql' then in opening and closing 
scope we just write 'true'.

But agin we have to change the value at 'Main.java' this time. with 
('Harsh','103' and '21') So, at output we got
"Hibernate: insert into Student (sAge,sName,rollNo) values (?,?,?)"
So, basically it will sending data.
