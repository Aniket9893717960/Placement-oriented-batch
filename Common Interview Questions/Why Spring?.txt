For Java beginners , if interviewer asks - Why Spring ? don’t just say “less boilerplate.”

Cover these points abt Spring :

1. Built on Strong Design Principles
Spring uses Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI).
This means objects are not created manually; Spring handles it.
Result: loose coupling and better testability.

2. Manages Core Application Concerns
Spring provides built-in support for:

REST APIs
Database access (JDBC, JPA)
Transaction management
Security
This lets developers focus on business logic.

3. Highly Modular Architecture
Spring is not one big monolith.
Use only what you need:

Spring Web for APIs
Spring Data for DB operations
Spring Security for auth

4. Spring Boot Simplifies Everything

Auto-configuration
Embedded server (like Tomcat)
Production-ready setup with minimal config
It reduces setup time and makes projects easier to start and maintain.

5. Production-Ready by Default

Built-in logging
Profiles for different environments
Health checks and metrics
It's mature and widely used in large-scale apps.
