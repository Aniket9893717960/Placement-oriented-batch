Now we know how to inject the property.
  The property which u are working with is a normal variable or
'Primitive' Variable. But what if  the property will not want to primitive
variable It's a 'Reference' let's example say go back to 'laptop'.

U normally do is u write code. U want this to work u want to get the 
output. u got the problem when u solve the problem. when u got to in your
brain also if u want to get the output or computing when the laptop there.

And then in your laptop u need a compiler. Let's say we have the method
name 'compile' in class 'Laptop' then u want to print 'Compiling'.

Now in 'Alien' we got the 'code' of course after coding we got the compile
method And if u want to call the method 'compile' u have to basically create
the object of laptop.Because u can't call 'compile' directly so, with 
'age' i also create a variable for 'laptop' name 'lap' and using this 
'lap' i want to call 'lap.compile'.

Write this program to 'Alien.java'

package org.aniket;

public class Alien {
    private int age;
    private Laptop lap;
    public Alien(){
        System.out.println("Object Created");
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        System.out.println("Setter called");
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void code() {
        System.out.println( "Coding" );
        lap.compile();
    }
}

But in output we Got a "NullPointerException" Because when we create an 
object for 'lap' we don't have the object yet It still refering to 
'null'. So, we have to create an object.
           private Laptop lap = new Laptop();

This will work but wait  a minute our primary motive is to manage the 
object by spring boot not our self.We want to inject this object.
Let's not do that so the question arrise how this work.

So, if u want this to work Is u go back to 'spring.xml' we got 2 
properties.
1. age        2. lap 
So, of course 'lap'is a private variable so,we have to make sure
so, we want getters setters for 'lap' as well. 
               -----------Summary---------
what we have done is we injected a value or the reference with the help
of reference attribute So, what ever values we have just like 'Alien' we
have 2 properties.
To assign the value in premitive we have 'values' And for Reference
we have ref in 'Properties' tag of 'spring.xml'.
               -------------X-------------

But Again u have to make sure that u have the reference created already 
here That's how u baiscally use 'ref' here to connect of course u have
multiple objects here.
let's say we have 'lap2' SO, we got 2 object's here 'lap1' and 'lap2'
2 different ids but and what ever id u maintoined in 'Properties' it
will be refered.
So, if u have multiple objects for laptop this id will differentiate
And that's how this things are basically working.

Here is the final programs 
i. App.java(Main)
 package org.aniket;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
public class App 
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
                ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");
                Alien obj = (Alien) context.getBean("alien");
                obj.setAge(21);
                System.out.print(obj.getAge());
                obj.code();
        }
    }

ii. spring.xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="

    <bean id="alien" class="org.aniket.Alien">
        <property name="age" value="21"></property>
        <property name="lap" ref="lap"></property>
    </bean>
    <bean id="lap" class="org.aniket.Laptop"></bean>
</beans>

iii. Alien.java
package org.aniket;

public class Alien {
    private int age;
    private Laptop lap;
    public Alien(){
        System.out.println("Object Created");
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        System.out.println("Setter called");
        this.age = age;
    }

    public Laptop getLap() {
        return lap;
    }

    public void setLap(Laptop lap) {
        this.lap = lap;
    }

    public void code() {
        System.out.println( "Coding" );
        lap.compile();
    }
}

iv. Laptop.java
package org.aniket;

public class Laptop {
    public Laptop(){
        System.out.println("Laptop Object Created");
    }

    public void compile() {
        System.out.println("Compiler");
    }
}
