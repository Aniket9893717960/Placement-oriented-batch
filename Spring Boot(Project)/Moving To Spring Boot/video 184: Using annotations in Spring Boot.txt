Ok so let's quickly make those changes First we talk about 'Alien' class
what we wanted is a variable name 'age'.
I also not want to work with 'laptop' Now i have to work with 'Computer'.
which i want to specify below.
             package com.telusko.app;
             import org.springframework.beans.factor;
             import or.springframework.sterotype.Component;
             @Component
             public class Alien {
               @Value('25')
               private int age;
               private Computer com;
               public int getAge(){return age;}
               public void setAge(int age){ this.age = age; }
               public Computer getCom(){ return com; }
               @Autowired
               public void setCom(Computer com){ this.com = com; }
               public void code(){
               com.compile();
               }
             }
Now we will create an interface name 'Computer' in the same package
This will have the method name 'void compile'.
CODE
    package com.telusko.app;
    public interface Computer {
        void compile();
    }
So, actually 'laptop' will implementin the 'Computer' interface.
CODE
        public class Laptop implements Computer 

Instead of saying 'laptop.compile' we say 'com.compile' in method
'code' of 'Alien'.
Then we have build getter's and setter's At 'Alien.java' for variables
name 'age' and 'com'.
Next thing i want to do is i didn't wanted to use '@Autowired' on the 
field i want to use '@Autowired' for the setter's of 'com'.
This are not the only changes in the 'Alien' i want to assign the value
in the field 'age' and 'com'. with the help of '@Value' annotation.

                 NOW Let's heat back to the laptop
In laptop we are not doing much we just say 'compile' and it just print
data. But apart from laptop we want more such data. Just like 'Computer'
I just done the changes here.
Program of Laptop: CODE
            package com.telusko.app;
            import or.springframework.sterotype.Component;
            @Component
            public class Laptop implements Computer {
              public void compile(){
                System.out.println("Compiling in laptop");
              }
            }
Just like 'Laptop' i want to write at 'Desktop' as well.
Program of Desktop: CODE
            package com.telusko.app;
            import or.springframework.sterotype.Component;
            @Component
            @Primary
            public class Desktop implements Computer {
              public void compile(){
                System.out.println("Compiling in laptop");
              }
            }
Now if u see 'Computer' has two implementation 'Laptop' and 'Desktop'.
But we got an error after running the program name
"Parameter 0 of method 'setCom' in 'com.telusko.app.Alien' required a 
single bean, but 2 were found." 
But we know the solution Just we add 'Primary' in 'Desktop' And if i 
writting 'Desktop' as 'primary' then in 'Alien.java' we have to use
'Qualifier' annotation like below.
CODE
               @Autowired
               @Qualifier("laptop")
               public void setCom(Computer com){ this.com = com; }
