So, we have done with the interface creation right.
We got one interface and we got one implementation but 
will this code work.
because we doesn't run the code in last video 
Now if we run the program we got error. This error will look 
interesting let's see what the error is 
"It cannot resolve the matching constructor"
Ok we are still dependent on constructor. what we will do is we go 
to the property one So, let me comment in 'spring.xml' file 
below section.
          <constructor-arg name="lap" ref="lap1" />
          <constructor-arg name="age" ref="21" />

And let's work with 'property' here.
          <property name="age" ref="21" />
          <property name="lap" ref="lap1" />
