Dependency Injection Is a design pattern used in Software Development -
especially in object oriented programming to reduce tight coupling 
components.
It is a form of Inversion of Control(loC), where the control of creating 
and injecting dependencies is transferred from the class itself to an 
external framework or container (like Spring framework).

 #Let's Understand with an Analogy:
imagine u are assembling a computer.
 * A tightly coupled system is like a motherboard that builds its own
   CPU, RAM, and SSD internally.
 * A loosely coupled system using Dependency Injection is like a 
   motherboard that accepts components (CPU,RAM,SSD) from outside
   - allowing flexibility to change any part easily.
