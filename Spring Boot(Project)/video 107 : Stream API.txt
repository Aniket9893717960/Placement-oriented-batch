In previous lec we witness 'foreach' loop what it i
  done the same work with 'Stream API'
If we Talk about 
                'Stream API' 
  Then 'Stream' is an interface the think is if i go back to 'nums' and after 
    that we place a '.' then automatically compiler will suggest some methods
    in which we got the new method like 'stream()' before Java 1.8 this method 
    is not there
