Till this section we were talk about JDBC the thing is if you talk about software 
industry this will all about 'data'. what ever we done for 'data' So, even if you
are building application so, that you interact with data.
  Updating data         Fetching data          Storing data

Till this point we work with data but in the form of variables
what if you store a no. this can be store in integer.
  If you want to store a point value then it will stored in 'double'.

But what if you closed your application
  the momont u close your application u lost all your data.
                  So, what we want is to store data paramanently somewhere?
  Of course there is one option that you store your data in normal file
  just like u create the '.txt' file to store it.

  But the problem in '.txt' is difficulty to search certain things
  It's difficult to maintain the relation ship between two different things.

  Example:
          If you are storing 'Name' and 'age' of the person and each person have
  there own name and there own age how will you search the particular age of 
  particular person It's very difficult in a '.txt' file.
  SO, we have the way to solve this and Solution name Is:
                   'Relational Database Management System'

  So, basically u can store your data in tabular format and that will be your 
  permanent storage of course there are some in memory database available but 
  let's say most of the DBMS are parmanent storage.

  But u can do is u can store the data in the database but the only problem is
  if you want to use this database u need to use SQL language which is
    'Structured Query Language'
