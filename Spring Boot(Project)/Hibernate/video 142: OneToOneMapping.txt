Now just implement One to One Realtionship
First replace '@Embeddable' in 'laptop.java'
   With '@Entity' And when u say '@Entity' u need primary key as '@Id'
We need getter setter for the 'lid'.
And i want to generate as 'toString' Generate 'toString' with all the
details.

Let's go back to 'Alien.java' and here But nothing we have to change here
So, we are going throw 'Main.java'.

And there are some changes i go throw in 'Main.java' are
i. Add the setter for 'lid' in 'Main.java' with this command.
                      l1.setLid(1);

Now one thing to observe when u say 'persist' we have to also 'persist' the
'laptop'.And the sequence i have to follow is 'laptop' first then 
'alien' because 'laptop' is the primary table now.
                             session.persist(l1);      
                             session.persist(a1);
