The thing is we are started with spring boot But the actual sense and
what happends behind the seen make much more sense once we do this in 
spring framework.
Why we are doing in spring boot is just to understand what spring boot
can do In term of "Dependency Injection" of course 'Spring Boot' can
do allot of different things .

But we are starting with the first step ok so first i say what we gonna 
do here Before that we have one more update we are using 'java 21' instead
of 'Java 17'.

package com.telusko.app;

import ...

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootDemoApplication {
   public static void main(String[] args){
    SpringApplication.run(SpringBootDemoApplication.class, args);
    System.out.println("Hello world");
   }
}

So, what we arer doing in 'SpringBootDemoApplication.java' we using
'SpringApplication.run' basically it activates your spring framework
It also has something called 'container' where u can contain your
  spring Beans.
As i maintoined before 'Spring' is responsible to create the objects
And this object is basically called 'Beans'.
So, any objects is created and manage by spring are called 'Beans'
Nothing feancy it's just normal object different name.

So, this is how u run the container but we are not using container 
in this code we just simply running "Hello World". So, Nothing about
Container's tail now.

                      Now i Use Container
                      -------------------
Now we will create a simple class in 'com.telusko.app' let's say
i want to write 'Alien' If u are not sure why u create or work with 
'Alien' besically i believe that programmers are 'Aliens' because
we don't leave in this world "Mentally" or "Virtually" we leave in
"Virtual" World right So, we are 'Aliens'.

'First' of all i wonna deactivate my "mitup" Copilate.
