To remove duplicate in the list in java, there are multiple ways depending on the 
requirement. Here are the most common ones:

1. Using 'Set'(Simple and Fast)
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Array.asList("Apple","bunana","apple","orange"));
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(list);
list = new ArrayList<>(Set);

System.out.println(list);
