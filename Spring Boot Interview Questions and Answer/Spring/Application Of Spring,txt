1. POJO Based: Spring allows developers to use POJOs to create enterprise 
               class apps. The advantage of using simply POJOs is that
you don't require an EJB container product like an application server
instead, u may use a powerful servlet container like Tomcat or a commercial
product.

2. Modular: Spring is set up in a modular approach. Even if there are a lot
            of packages and classes, u only need to worry about the ones
u need and ignore the rest.

3. Integration with Existing framework: Spring does not reinvent the wheel
                                        rather, it makes extensive 
technologies such as numerous ORM frameworks, logging frameworks, JEE,
Quartz
