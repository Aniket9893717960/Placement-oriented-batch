Now that we have learned how to create an 'object' in Javascript,
we should also learn how to access data from an object.
To access the value of a particular key in an object, we typically
use two notations :
                       i.  Dot Notations
                      -------------------
In Javascript is a way to access properties or methods of an object using
a dot(.) followed by the property or method name.
Example : Find create an object person with name and age as it's properties
          and a message as it's method.
                   const person = {
                   name = 'Mayank',
                   age = 21,
                   message : function() {
                   console.log('Helloooooooooo!');
                   }
                  };
         let myName = person.name;           // Mayank
         let myAge = person.age;           // 21
         let message = person.message();        // Hellooooo!

                      ii. Bracket Notation
                      --------------------
In Javascript is another way to access properties or methods of an object
square breackets ([]) with the property or method name enclosed within 
them.
                    const person = {
                      name : 'Mayank',
                      age : 21,
                      message : function() {
                      console.log('Helloooooo!');
                      }
                    };
                    let myName = person["name"];
                    let myAge = person["age"];
                    let message = person["message"]();

                    /* Output :
                    Mayank
                    21
                    Hellooooooo!
                    */

                    Dot Notation V/S Bracket Notation
                    ----------------------------------
You most be thinking that why two different ways to access the properties
what is the different, and which one is more convenient?.
The answer is "we cannot use 'Dot Notation' when the property name or 
method of an object contains special characters, space or starts with a
number".
Example :                  const person = {
                                    "name" : 'Mayank',
                                    "lage" : 21,
                                };
                  let myName = person["name"];
                  let myAge = person["lage"];

                  /* Output :
                  Mayank
                  21
                  */

If we use 'Dot Notation' for the above example we get...
                 const person = {
                   "name" : "Mayank",
                   "lage" : 21,
                  }
                 let myName = person.name;
                 let myAge = person.lage;

                    /* Output :
                                  ERROR
                    */
              --------------------NOTE----------------
Mostly, we will be using the Dot Notation only in our programs but 'Bracket Notation' is one of the most important tools which we shouldn't forget as it has specific uses and can be life saviour in interviews.

                   Modifying objects and its properties
                   ------------------------------------
when it's comes to objects in javascript, we gain access to numerous features.
One of the most powerful capabilities is that we can easitly add, delete 
or modify properties within our objects at any time and in anu place within our 
code.

                           Adding Property
                          -----------------
Let's suppose we have a person object and we have only two existing properties
firstName and age. Now, we want to add lastName and isRunning as the properties of
the person object we can do this by assigning values to these new properties as :
                         const person = {
                            firstName : "Mayank",
                            age : 21
                           };
                      person.lastName = "Pandey";
                      person.isRunning = false;

                           console.log(person);
                      /* Output :
            {firstName: 'Mayank', age: 21, lastName: 'Pandey', isRunning: false}
                        */
