It's time to create a controller. How do we do that? see what happens
behind the scenes. We just look forward to see in the normal Spring.
Here we are just seeing how do we create one. then we'll understand how
things are getting called later,

but at this point be with me. So, what do is in my package, let me create a
simple class, not a servlet, a simple class, And let me name this class as
"HomeController".

That means we can create multiple controls in the project. And that make
sense, right? for different instance u should create a different Controller.
Here I'm saying HomeController. Let me create one.

Now this below is your "Controller", okay? But will it really work?
CODE in 'HomeController.java'
     package com.aniket.SpringBootWeb1;
     public class HomeController {
     }
See, the thing is if you are using a SpringBoot app. Or if u are using a
Spring framework for the web, we have to specify that 'HomeController'
has something special.

And the way u can do that or interact with your Spring framework By 
specifying a special meaning Is with the help of 'Annotation'.
               -------------X--------------
Example: If u want something to be a Spring-managed object, that's why
         u use '@Component'. If u want to make this Controller,
If u want to make this Controller we use Something called
'@Component' Which is a stereotype Annotation, and that's it.
           You are making a 'Controller' here.
