      ----------NOTE----------------
1) Difference Between block ELement and Inline Element?

2) In this below program we try to build navigation bar
   at the header so as we run this then our expected 
   output should be visible at Horizontal line Orderly.
   But it should be visible at vertical line not horizontal
   So, how we achive this? That's our Question?

   "<nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=""></a></li>
            <li><a href=""></a></li>
            <li><a href=""></a></li>
            <li><a href=""></a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>"
   And we also try to remove 'doutes' in this?

3) how we build a 'Bookmark' using anchor tag?
         -----------X------------
In this lecture we talk about 
'Html in speed'

First thing which help to achive our goal:

'Emmet' this are the software plugin by 
default install in 'VS Code Editor'.
But if you use any other Editior like
'Sublime Text','Notpad' Then u need to 
install this.

'Emmet' main work is to provide auto generate 
Short cuts to build Full code in short time.

Mainly we use two attributes very 
commonly name "class" and 'Id'
we see this two in short.

Id: It's the attribute which is used to define 
uniquly Indentification element. 
Example :- It we have 40 different things
           and data in web page to identfy it 
one by one. This will be our answer to done 
that.

Class : It's like a parent level Entity.
        In class the multiple elements will be 
Exist at the same time.
It will basically use for the grouping of elements
To make the changes in the cult/group.

div : it's kind of non semantic tag in which
At this we cannot provide any meaning in this.
It's just to create a 'division'.

So, basically why we use this tag.
i. it's a generic container tag.
ii. It's generally used for wrapping of data.
It will be used as a container.

At this we were Exist of two kind of elements
i. Block Element : This are the element which comes
 ------- -------- under 'next line'.
It will get all the space from left - Right.
Example :  If u attach 'background-color' in 'div'
          tag and it's covers all the elements
throw the line.If the next element is also block 
elements than in output it comes at next line.

ii. Inline Element : This are the element which not comes
    ------ ------- under 'next line'.
It will get all the spaces on the specified content.
Example :  If u attach 'background-color' in 'span'
          tag and it's covers only part of content
will come.If the next element is also lnline
elements than in output it comes at same line.
