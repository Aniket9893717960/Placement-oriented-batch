There are many useful features of Spring Boot. Some of them are 
mentioned below:
               AUTO - CONFIGURATION
Spring Boot automatically configures dependencies by using 
"@EnableAutoConfiguration" annotation and reduces boiler plate code.

              Spring Boot Starter POM
These Starter POMs are pre - configured dependencies for functions like
database, security, maven configuration etc.

          Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface)
This command line tool is generally managing dependencies, creating 
projects and running the application.

                      Actuator
Spring Boot Actuator provides health check, metrics and monitors the 
endpoints of the application. It also simplifies the troubleshooting
management.

                   Embedded Servers
Spring boot contains embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty for quick 
application run. No need of external servers.
