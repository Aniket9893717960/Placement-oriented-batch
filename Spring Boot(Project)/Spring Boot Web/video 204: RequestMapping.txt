Okay, so let's solve this problem of mapping. 
The thing is if u want to map this, you don't have to do any qualification
for the XML, luckily. we have to use annotation.

Now, which annotation we have to use? So for this, for mapping the request.
we have to use annotation call Request Mapping. And in this mapping u have
to pass the path.

The path here is 'homepage'. So, whenever someone calls the 'homepage',
this is something I want to execute. It is as simple as that. Just a 
request mapping, it will come to know that this is a mapping we have to do.

which is for the 'slash'. Yeah, if you're doing for the students, u can
also say 'student'. but at this point i want to map it for the '/'
'homepage'. And that's the only change u have to make.

let's refresh this taking some time, go back to your browser. And say,
refresh and done. Something happend:
"Okay, it's not the same thing which we were expecting.We are executing a
page. But u can see it says, Do you want to allow downloads on local
host?"

If u say allow something got downloaded. If i see here it says unknown 
file. I mean that's weird.
