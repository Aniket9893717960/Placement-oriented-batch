Now let's work with 'OneToMany' So, what i want to do now is
As an 'Alien' we have 'Laptop' we got one here.
  When u say multiple we have to provide the 'list' of laptop.
And we also input the package of 'list'.
Now we will change this to 'laptops' not 'laptop'

                   import java.util.List;
                    @OneToMany
                  private List<Laptop> laptops;

Then we have to make changes in ' Getter's And Setter's '
And 'toString'as well
Now the problem is in 'main.java'. 
               a1.setLaptop(l1);
Gives error because we doesn't have a single 'laptop' we have the
list of laptop i can't pass one. And since we only have one laptop
here. 
Either we can say list or 
              a1.setLaptops(Array.asList(l1,l2));

and Create the object of 'Laptop' class name 'l2' and pass the data
('3','Lenovo','LOQ','12') and set this data into 'laptop'.
Now at downer 'Session'. we add below command.
                      session.persist(l2);
