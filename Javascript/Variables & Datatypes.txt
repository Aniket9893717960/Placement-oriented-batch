If we talk about any programming language like
C++, Java, Javascript in this all languages
it's compulsory to work on the data.

We have so many Data stucture which store data.
The different data structure will have different 
methods/techniques or return to fatch data 
techniques is different.

If we talk about Data handling and Storage
so, Variables are something which is very 
    ---------
important thing.

A simplest entity to store the data are variables
without confusing 'Variable' term we make it's
meaning in simplest form then
Variables are Named memory Locations.
              ----------------------
              if we store different data's in variables
              It will take Different space some data take
              space of 4 byte,some are 8 bytes and many more

In the memory if you have to identify some data uniqely
It only possible when u have to identify with the 
help of address.
In short if you try to store any value or access any
value it only done with the help of address.
