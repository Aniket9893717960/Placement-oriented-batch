Now let's create a Controller which can accept this request.
Because if u see the 'HomeController'. Of course we can create a new 
controller here, a new class, but then Spring allows u to have multiple
controllers in one controller.

So, may i Spring allows u to have multiple requests mapped in one 
particular controller. and logically, if u have different types of 
controllers, let's say u have different types of requests.

So, if u are making an e-commerce website and u want to request for user,
so user addition, or maybe adding a user, deleting a user, or updating
a user, so every thing that deals with the user, u can put that in one
controller.

Maybe u can have the controller for products where u can add a product,
remove a product, remove a product, update a product. u can have a 
controllers for the orders, place the order, delete the order, change 
the status of the order.

So, u can have that in the OrderController. But here, since we only have 
two controls now, let's work with the same 'HomeController'. what i will
do is? if u want to have something that will accept the request,
u have to create another method.

So, at this point, i will say 'public' String because maybe I want to 
return a page, of course, right? when u add two numbers, u also want a
page, and that's what u're expecting in the browser.

So, if u see in the output, when u send this request, this should be
another page. Okay, so that means I have to return something, and 
then we can have a method name.

Mathod name can be anything.I will say 'add' here and open bracket close.
close brackets below is the code.
CODE IN 'HomeController'
                      public String add(){}

Okay now here I want to return the name of a page. So, what's should be
the name of the page? I will simply say return. when can return any page
name. I will say return 'result.jsp'.
CODE IN 'HomeController'
                      public String add(){
                            return "result.jsp";
                      }

But then will it be getting called?
