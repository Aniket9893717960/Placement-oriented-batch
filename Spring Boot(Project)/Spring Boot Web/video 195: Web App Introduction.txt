In this module, we'll talk about web application.
when we talk about spring as a framework, it has multiple project inside it.
So, it's a umbrella for multiple projects.
And one of the project, in fact, there are multiple projects and deals with
web application. So, if u wanted to build a web application, u can use 
something called Spring web.

And otherwise, if u don't want to use Spring boot, we also have spring MVC 
there. Now why exactly we need to build web apps? Again, that's a weird
question, right? Because we all know the answer.

the world is working on web applications. of course, you do have mobile 
applications, but then for every mobile app, okay, not every, but 99.99%
of mobile application also have a web application.

So, the back end remains same fot the front end of your desktop and 
front end of your mobile application. So, can i say that the client,
the browser client, and the mobile application most of the time having
same server.

         Mobile              Browser 
       Application            Client
           |--------------------|
                     |
                   SERVER
And we are here to focus on how do you build that server? because see,
if you talk about a client, it can be a mobile or a desktop, maybe on 
the browser
