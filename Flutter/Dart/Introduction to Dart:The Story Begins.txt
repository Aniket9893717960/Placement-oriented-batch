                      What Is Dart?
Dart is a Programming language made by Google in 2011. 
It was created to provide a simple, fast and productive language mainly for
building mobile, desktop, backend and web applications.
Google wanted a Language that:
 *Could run bot on web Browsers and Mobile devices efficiently.
 *Is easy to learn and easy to write, yet powerful enough to create
 complex apps.
 *Solves problems that languages like JavaScript had in creating apps With
  smooth performance.  
                 
             Why Do we Need Dart?
Before Dart, developers primarily used JavaScript for web apps and other
languages like Java or Kotlin for mobile apps.But:
 *Javasript is flexible but can get messy and slow in big projects.
 *Mobile apps needed a single language that works everywhere without
  losing performance.
 *Dart brings a balance: It's fast because it compiles directly to machine
  ---------------------- Code (native code), and it's also productive 
  because it has simple syntax and powerful features.

           Why Does Flutter Use Dart?
Flutter, which is Google's UI toolkit for building apps, uses Dart mainly 
because Dart's unique strengths:
1. Performance: Dart compiles to native code (ARM machine code for mobile)
                making apps fast and smooth.
2. Hot Reload: Dart supports "hot reload" meaning when u change your code,
               the app updates instantly without restarting. This makes
               development faster and more fun.
3. Single Language for FrontEnd and Backend: Dart can be used both for UI
                      Code(Flutter) and backend/server code, so developers
   can use one language for everything.
4. Object-Oriented And Modern: Dart is easy to learn if u already know     
                          languages like Java or C#, yet it has modern 
features(like async/await,null safety) that make writing bugs free and 
perfomant apps easier.

        Basic Concepts of Dart - Designed for Everyone?
*Easy to Read and Write: Dart uses easy words and simple rules so begineers
                        can pick it up quickly.
*Statically Typed: This means Dart checks Your code For mistakes before 
                   running it, helping U catch errors early.
*Supports Mobile and Web: Dart can build apps for Android,IOS, web browsers
                          and even desktop from the same codebase.
*Modern Languages: Dart keeps evelving with the latest programming features
                   So, u stay Up to Date with new Tech.

                  How Did Dart Come About?
Google first launched Dart in 2011 to replace complex web programming
challenges with a language optimized for UI(User interface) work. Later
with the arrival of flutter, Dart become even more essential because it 
perfectly fits flutter's goals of fast, beautiful and responsive mobile app
development.

 *Dart is a simple yet powerful language
