           ----NOTE---
we also use 'else-if' without else because 'else'
here is 'optional' at this case.
           -----X-----
We are talking about two things.
                      |--> If - Else Statement
                      |--> Switch Statement
First we are talking about If-Else With Example :
 consition 1 : If my age is Greater than 18 So,
               I have a right to vote.
 Condition 2 : If '1' is 'false' then come to this 
               case where 'I Doesn't capable to vote.'

Now we build a program on this match this 2 conditions.
    let age = 3;
    if(age >= 18)
        console.log('can vote');
    else
        console.log('cannot vote');

                      SWITCH Case
                      ------------
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
