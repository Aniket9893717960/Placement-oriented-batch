Now try to Execute 'Multiple Threads' simultaniously
of course in the previous program it will running the same 
thing but i want 'hi' and 'hii' one after the other
because In the previous program there are so, many 'hi'
than we are going throw 'hii' and same goes to whole 
program output.

How do we do that the thing is u doesn't control your 
'Scheduler' u can suggest the 'scheduler' to give the 
priority so, yes we have the concept of 'Thread Priority'.

And under this we have the concept of 'Top Thread Priority'
I just want to understand what is the current Priority of the
Thread.
