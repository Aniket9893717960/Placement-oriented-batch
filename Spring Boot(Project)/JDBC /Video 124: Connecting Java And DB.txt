Now we are connecting JDBC to DB And for this
in the project "JDBCCourse"
so, first we gone to 'src' folder and i will say 'new' and i 
will create a '.java' file  and we can name anything to this
is 'DemoJdbc.java' and also we need a main method.
Now we will write 
        those following steps:
        /*
         import package
         load and register : Of course this is optional
         create connection
         create statement
         execute statement  : Here we execute the statement
         process the results  
         class
         */
i. We have to import the packages.
ii. we have to register the driver I told you there are different kind
     of driver for different tool 
   a. Postgresql :
                org.postgresql.Driver
   b. Mysql :
               com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
This were come at the optional step but if u wanna do then u can use this 
command.
         Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
               ---------------NOTE---------------
if we write the wrong path "Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");" then it gives
ClassNotFoundException
               -----------------X---------------
SO, this is how u basically load the driver Now this might throw an exception
So, u can simply say 'throws ClassNotFoundException' but this will make the code 
look complex i will suggest u instead of 'throws' u use 'try-catch'.

iii. Connection means u have to connect your application to the database
      and the way u do that is by creating a connection object;
                 Connection con = null; also import java.sql.Connection;

     Can i say 'new Connection' the problem is 'Connection' is an 'Interface'
     it's not a class so, u have to look for the implementation for this 
U have something called 'DriverManager' in which u have the method called
'getConnection' so, basically it gives u the implementation right
               'getConnection' have the return type of 'Connection'
So, this get connection will basically asked for 3 parameters 
      'url'     'uname'       'pass'
Now intellij will tell u the thing as well this is the first, second and 3rd one
it might throw  an exception so, we can simply say throws.

      SO, what's URl? Now of course right here java application with database then
your java have to know which DBMS u were working with but also u have to provide the 
database name
U know 'Mysql','PostgreSQl' are the network Databases that this are available throw
network. First we create a 
               String url = "";
               String uname =  "";
               String pass = "";
So, we got this 3 things the url say
    a. java would be connecting with what?(jdbc)
    b. 'jdbc' will connect with database name 'mysql'.
    c. u have to maintoined the database name 'demo' only thing is database will
be available on the networkso, u have to maitoind the IP address and Port no.
So, this will be on the same machine which is IP address is "localhost" then
we are using mysql so, it's port no. is '3306'('5432' for 'Postgres')

               String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo";
                AND Final Connection will be vidible link this
              con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,uname,pass);
                   ------------NOTE--------------
if we done some mistake in "con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,uname,pass);" code
it will give 'java.sql.Exception'. But for specific mistackes there are different 
suggestion for 'java.sql.Exception'.
i. If we done mistake in 'url' then Exception is
 "java.sql.SQLException: No suitable dirver found for <GIVEN URL>"
ii. If we done mistake in 'uname' and 'pass' then Exception is
 "com.mysql.jdbc.util.PSQLException : FATAL: password authentication failed 
      for user 'root' "
                  ----------------X----------

NOW the LAST 3 STEPS will be seen in the next video 125
