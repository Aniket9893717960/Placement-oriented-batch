Before Start with 'Stream API' First of all it's a New concept come in
java 1.8 and it provides some Amazing features The first point is 
why do we need those features we need to understand that first.
              ---------NOTE--------------
For avoid manually add Specific Data in the List one by one
we add all the data in the List with the help of 
'asList' method :It will gives you a list and it belong to a class
--------         called 'Arrays'
Syntax : 
      List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4,5,7,2);
              -------------X------------
If we print 'nums' values then at output we got the values of
'nums'.
But if i don't want all the values just i want some specific values 
like let's say i want only Even value and Double Each value and also
take the submition of all.
For this we use 'for' loop like this
              int sum =0;
              for(int n : nums){
                  if(n%2 == 0){
                      n = n*2;
                        sum = sum +n;
                     }
                 }                       //It's Output is 24
