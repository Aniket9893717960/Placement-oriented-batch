Now let's talk about 'collection'. The funny thing is 
in this topic we have three Different Type of collection.

The first we have 'collection APT'
                  ----------------
The second one is collection
                  -----------
The last one is collections
                -----------

This is the most confusing thing in this.
When we are talking about 'collection API'
then we talk about 'concept'.

If we start with collection then we talk about
'Interface'.

At last In 'Collections' we talk about 'class'.
