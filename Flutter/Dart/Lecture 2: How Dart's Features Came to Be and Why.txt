         1. Variables And Strong Typing:
            Why are Variables Important?
i. What are Variables?
 Think of variables as labeled boxes where u store things like numbers,
 words or true/false values. For Example: u store your age in a box called
 "age".

ii. Why Does Dart Use Strong Typing?
 Dart is statically typed, which means when u put something in the box,
 u must decide ahead of time what type of thing it can hold. This is like
 telling the box "You can only hold apples" rather than any random fruit.

iii. Reason:
 This helps the computer catch mistakes early. For example, if u make a
 math operation on something that isn't a number, Dart will return u before
 running the program. This saves a lot of time fixing bugs later.

         2. Functions: The Recips Cards of Programming
1. What are Functions?
 Imagine a handy recipe card that tells u how to make your favorite dish
 step by step. Functions in Dart are like these recipe cards: they define
 a set of instructions u can use whenever needed.

2. Why Does Dart Use Functions?
 Functions help keep your code clean and reusable. Instead of repeating
 yourself, u write the recipe once and follow it many times.

 Reason:  This makes programs easier to read, understand, and maintain.
         It helps e
