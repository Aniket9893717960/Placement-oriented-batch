       EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ABOUT INVERSION OF CONTROL WITH EXAMPLE?
Inversion of Control (loC) is a design principle in Software Engineering
where the control of object creation and their dependencies is inverted
from the program itself to an external container or framework (like Spring).

Instead of the application code controlling the flow and creating objects,
the framework(Spring) takes over this control and manages object creation
and dependency wiring.

    #Why is loC Used?
 To achieve loose coupling between classes.
