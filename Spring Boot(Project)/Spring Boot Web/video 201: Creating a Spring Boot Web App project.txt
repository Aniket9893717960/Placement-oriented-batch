Now let's see how do we create a web application with the help of Spring?
So, of course we have talk about MVC project with the help of Spring
framework.
  
And the beauty is there are two ways of doing it. One is using normal
Spring framework. And second with the help of Spring Boot. And we know till
this point that if u want to do something with Spring boot, it is much
easier.

And if u wanna do something with Spring framework, u have to done some 
configuration. So, we'll start with Spring boot. Let's understand the 
concept. How do u build a web application using Spring Boot?

And once u understand enough, then we'll see how do we create a same 
project with the help of normal Spring MVC? And u can see the difference
that how much configuration we can save with the help of Spring Boot.

Now question arise, if u want to create a Spring boot project, how will 
u do it?
It's simple
i. Go to 'start.spring.io' which is your initializer, or if you're using
   Eclipse with the Spring tools or if u are using intellij Ultimate 
   version in that case u will get the option directly in your IDE. 
But since we are using the community version of intellij, which is
free one, we don't have that option directly in IDE. And that's why we
use 'initializer'.
So, let's go to initializer and here i will create a project.

ii. Now what kind of project i want, i want a 'Maven' project. So, i
will select that, the language is Java. Then in the Spring Boot I have 
to mention a version. So, i will go for '3.2'.
