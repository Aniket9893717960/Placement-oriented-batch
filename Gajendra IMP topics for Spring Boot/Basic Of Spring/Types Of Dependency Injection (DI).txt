Dependency injection mainly comes in 3 types:
 1. Constructor Injection
 2. Setter Injection
 3. Field Injection

                  CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION
Dependencies are injected at the time of object creation.
Uses Constructor parameters to inject all mandatory dependencies.

   #Advantages:
i. Promotes immutability - dependency is final.
ii. Encourages writing testable and robust code.
iii. Fails fast - If any required dependency is missing, object won't 
                  be created.
iv. works perfectly with "@Autowired", Lombok "@RequiredArgsConstructor"
    , etc.

  #Disadvantages:
i. if too many dependencies (bad design), the consturctor becomes bloated
   (called Constructor Bloat).
ii. Not suitable for optiona dependencies.
