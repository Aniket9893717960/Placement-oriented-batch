In this video we are talking about Exceptions.
Before you Understand this we have to first Understand types of Error then we have 
Different types for it.
 1) Compile time Error
 2) Run time Error
 3) Logical Error
How do we Describe this let's say i want to print something.But 
we make a mistake in Printing command like i write 'P' in '.println'
of course your IDE will give you an error here But if you ignore
that and compile it give error "cannot find symbol"
This will called Syntactical/Compile Time Error.
                 ------------------------------

2) Logical Error: it means every thing is working there is not
   --------------              compile time issue.
               System.out.println(2+2);
But as not doing the simple calculation where output is not '4'
it's '5' and it's working there is no compiler time issue,
not run time but output you are getting is wrong.
Now this type of error are logical error.
Actually  some times this problem are diffuclt to solve
you need to do allot of testing.

Example:
-------
When you heard about this whenever you working in an 
application in that case you were do testing,you
check for the input and output and everything that you 
were not able to solve this problem.

But the think is from the Developers side. he will check 
compile time issues.You do proper testing for logical 
issues.If you shift this to client than, client is
happy.
There is no compile time issue,run time issue or logical issue

3) Run time Error: it means every thing is working there is not
   --------------              compile time issue. 
Your code is working as well but suddenly because of some reason
the code will stop working. You got errors so basically if you
get run time your exeution normally stops and that's an issue.
