Let we work with 'Alien' object as well. we worked with 'Desktop'
now we create 'bean' for the laptop. So, what we wanna do is 
the same thing what i can done before
In 'App.java' when we configure the 'spring.xml'.
We write the below things:
  Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien1",Alien.class);
    obj1.setAge(21);
    System.out.println(obj1.getAge());
    obj1.code();

but we change this thing.
      For working with "Java Based Config".
1. At "Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien1",Alien.class);"
  we just not maintoined the name we just work with 'Alien.class'.
Same we are just setting the age. then we are saying 'getAge'.
Then we call code.

2.We doesn't want to work with 'Desktop' any more so, we just 
remove below lines in 'App.java'.
CODE:
    Desktop dt = context.getBean(Desktop.class);
    dt.compile();
    Desktop dt1 = context.getBean(Desktop.class);
    dt.compile();  

Now in 'AppConfig.java' we don't want to work 'Desktop' method as 
'prototype'.
         @Configuration
            public class AppConfig {
             @Bean
             //@Scope("prototype")
             public Desktop desktop(){
              return new Desktop();
             }
            }

Now if we run the program we got an error. This is the error for 'Alien'.
"No qualifying Bean of type alien" why? because in the 'AppConfig'.
we doesn't maintoined anything about 'Alien'.
Now we add below code in 'AppConfig'.

       @Bean
       public Alien alien(){
         return new Alien();
       }
Now if u notice in 'AppConfig' total we have two '@Bean' annotation.
If we run the program we got the error after 
i. Gotting the object of 'Alien' And 'Desktop'
What is the reason behind this error?
in 'App.java' we write 'obj.code' command. because 'code' is dependent 
on the object of 'Computer' at 'Alien.java'.

we have to make sure because in the 'xml configuration' we make sure 
that 'spring.xml' property name 'com' has the reference to bean.
like below command.
      <property name="com">
       <bean id="com1" class="com.telusko.Laptop" primary="true"></bean>
      </property>
but in 'AppConfig' there is not linking between 'Alien' and 'Desktop'.
And i also want the initial value of the 'Age' which is '21'.
I want to write 'getAge' and i should want '21' in return.

So, i done certain changes in 'AppConfig.java' given below.
CODE:
     @Bean
     public Alien alien(){
      Alien obj = new Alien();
      obj.setAge(21);
      return obj;
     }
But mind you 'Computer' in 'Alien.java' is still 'null' because 
'Alien.java' has 2 variable 'age' and 'com'. So, age is '21' but
'com' is still run so let we run the program and got error.
So, now i done change in 'AppConfig.java' below.
CODE:
     @Bean
     public Alien alien(){
      Alien obj = new Alien();
      obj.setAge(21);
      obj.setCom(desktop());
      return obj;
     }

It will solve current problem but occur one more problem is 
"obj.setCom(desktop());" command. we make 'desktop' tightly coupled.
but what if u have 'Laptop'. So, we don't want "desktop()" in
"setCom".
What we can do to solve this problem is
1. In 'Alien' constructor we maintoined 'Computer' object.
2. inner 'Alien' constructor we replace "obj.setCom(desktop());"
   code with "obj.setCom(com);".
CODE:
     @Bean
     public Alien alien(Computer com){
      Alien obj = new Alien();
      obj.setAge(21);
      obj.setCom(com);
      return obj;
     }
And our compiler say ok the given constructor is dependent on 
'Computer' object. Then it will see the container and say
"Hey i want the 'Computer' object" and computer say 
"Hey i have the Desktop object." which is a 'Computer'.
               ----------NOTE------------
In the New Version we don't have to maintoined the '@Autowired' but
in previous verions we have to use '@AutoWired' like below.
CODE:
     @Bean
     public Alien alien(@Autowired Computer com){
      Alien obj = new Alien();
      obj.setAge(21);
      obj.setCom(com);
      return obj;
     }
               ------------X--------------
