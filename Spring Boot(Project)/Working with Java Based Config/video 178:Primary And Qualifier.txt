Now we were happy to handle one computer instance. Let me do this for 
the 'laptop' as well.
So, we add below command in 'AppConfig.java'.
CODE:
     @Bean
  public Laptop laptop(){
    return new Laptop();
  }
But the problem is when we run this code. And we got an error 
the error says
"No qualifying bean of type 'Computer' available:expected single
matching bean but found 2".

So, how do we solve this problem. When it comes to 'xml' config
we have 2 ways.
  1. u can explicitly maintoined which 'com' u want.
  Example: <property name="com" ref="com1">
            How same thing i can done in 'AppConfig'?
    We can do this with the help of annotation name "Qualifier".
So, what 'qualifier' means is 
"In this qualifier u can maintoied the name of the qualifier"
when we say "Desktop" then it always refer to "Desktop."
Program is given below:
         @Bean
  public Alien alien(@Qualifier("desktop") Computer com){
      Alien obj = new Alien();
      obj.setAge(21);
      obj.setCom(com);
      return obj;
     }

  2. If we don't want to use "Qualifier" then what's the solution
If u remember in "XML Configuration" we study about 'primary' 
keyword. Then we use the same name of annotation called 
"@Primary".
         @Bean
         @Primary
  public Laptop laptop(){
    return new Laptop();
  }
Now 'Laptop' will get the first preference.
