                      What Is Dart?
Dart is a Programming language made by Google in 2011. 
It was created to provide a simple, fast and productive language mainly for
building mobile, desktop, backend and web applications.
Google wanted a Language that:
 *Could run bot on web Browsers and Mobile devices efficiently.
 *Is easy to learn and easy to write, yet powerful enough to create
 complex apps.
 *Solves problems that languages like JavaScript had in creating apps With
  smooth performance.  
                 
             Why Do we Need Dart?
Before Dart, developers primarily used JavaScript for web apps and other
languages like Java or Kotlin for mobile apps.But:
 *Javasript is flexible but can get messy and slow in big projects.
 *Mobile apps needed a single language that works everywhere without
  losing performance.
 *Dart brings a balance: It's fast because it compiles directly to machine
  ---------------------- Code (native code), and it's also productive 
  because it has simple syntax and powerful features.

           Why Dart For Flutter?
