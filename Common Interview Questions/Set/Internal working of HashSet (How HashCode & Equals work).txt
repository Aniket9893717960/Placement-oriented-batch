                 WHAT IS A "HashSet"?
*A HashSet is a Set implementation based on hashing.
*It stores only unique elements.
*It uses a "HashMap" internally to manage those elements.
*You don't see the map, but everything u add to the "HashSet" goes into a 
 "HashMap" behind the scenes.
  CODE:
          HashSet<E> set = new HashSet<>();
          set.add("Apple");
   // Internally: HashMap<E, Object> map = new HashMap<>();

*A dummy object called "PRESENT"(usually new Object()) is stored as the 
 value:
  CODE:
          map.put(element, PRESENT);
