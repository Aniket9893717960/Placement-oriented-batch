u have to learn something before start of spring framwork.
1) u have to make sure that your core java knowledge is good.
   syntax of java
   opps concept
   Exception handling
   Threads
   Collection API.

2) JDBC: when u have to build application than 
        the most important thing is data.
 when u have to work with databases.
 u should know about how to connect Application with databases.

For that when u have normal java and database then u have JDBC in
between which is 'Java Database Connectivity'.

3) U want to build the spring project then u need to have a 
'Build tool' it can be maven or Gradle.
In this course we are going to use 'maven'.

4) Then u have to work with the 'Spring ORM' like 'Hibernate'
   atleast ORM will be required.

5) One last thing which is 'Servlets'. when u want to build 
web application using spring then u should know servlets.
Yes u have hourd some where that 'Servlets' are outdated
Yes they are if you want to build web application then
u are not using servlets u are using 'Spring MVC'.

But when u want to work with 'Spring MVC' then it run on 
some server like 'Apache Tomcat'.
what is 'Tomcat' it's a 'Servlet Container' so, having
  the knowledge of servlets will be useful otherwise
if i talk about spring mvc then i can give u brief idea.

On how servlet works and that's it
