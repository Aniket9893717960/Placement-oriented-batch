Till this point we were able to create a Spring Project with the 
help of 'XML Config' So, whatever spring we are able to manage we were 
doing that in XMl file name "Spring.xml". 
Of course this name can change the only thing we have to change is this
below thing u know.
    ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");
That working with 'spring.xml' we are working with some other name as 
well. 
Fine we can go with any name But Now let's say we don't want to use 
'xml' loot of people are not a big fan of xml.
So, they prefer to go for 'Java Based Config'. So, yes for the spring
u can done this configuration using java core.

So, if u are happy with xml u can continue with that If u are not happy 
u can try out the "java Based Config".
Some times u don't have a choise when u join a project and they are using 
'xml' of course they have to use 'xml' If they are using
'Java Based Configuration' we have one more way called 
'Annotation based Configuration' which will do latter.

But let's see how do you work with 'java Based Configuration" 
What we can do is?
we don't want to use the 'xml' approach while we want to use 
'Java Based approach'.
Of course for that we have to use java file. So, what we can do
with this package name "org.aniket"-> New -> Java Class.
But Before this first we create a "New Package" name "config".

Inside this "config" package we say "New Java Class".
