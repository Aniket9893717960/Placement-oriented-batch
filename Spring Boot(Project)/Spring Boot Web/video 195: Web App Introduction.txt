In this module, we'll talk about web application.
when we talk about spring as a framework, it has multiple project inside it.
So, it's a umbrella for multiple projects.
And one of the project, in fact, there are multiple projects and deals with
web application. So, if u wanted to build a web application, u can use 
something called Spring web.

And otherwise, if u don't want to use Spring boot, we also have spring MVC 
there. Now why exactly we need to build web apps? Again, that's a weird
question, right? Because we all know the answer.

the world is working on web applications. of course, you do have mobile 
applications,
