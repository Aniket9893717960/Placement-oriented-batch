Now in the last video we will created 2 objects
i. 'Alien'
ii. 'Laptop'

I thinking that 2 different objects I am not sure u are thinking this
logically if u think we got 'Alien' object's 2 times right.
  Now the question is we will create 2 object or 1 object while revising 
the concept in the last video.
Even u call 'getBean' 2 times in total we got only one object.
let me prove that with one more thing.
    1st in 'Alien' we will create the variable as well
  Normally we will create the variable with the private access
But let's say we are going with the variable 'age'.

We don't need 'getters' and 'setters' because we will not making the 
variable private but logically u should do that I will go back here and
print about the object 'age'.
If we change the 'obj1.age' value we run the program.

we see both 'obj1.age' and 'obj2.age' containes the same value.
The reason being we will created the 'bean' object only one.
 <bean id = "alien1" class = "com.telusko.Alien"></bean>

So, no matter how many times u say 'getBean' it will create the same 
object. 
Now why it's happening Because if we talk about 'bean' it have different
scope because scope is very important
