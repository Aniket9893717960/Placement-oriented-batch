'Code your First Program in html'
this is our main goal u have to achive
at this file.

First we have to start with the Question that
 'what is html?'
if i am a collage professior then i spake 
'It is Hyper text Markup Language'

But the 'main' thing is what is exactly 'HTML'
is 'It's full form is not enough for me.'

Here is the Answer of given Question
Is "Html is a language which use to 
define structure of the Data."

In the journey of mern stack we study about
'html','css','Javascript' make him with the ruff 
defination.

If i talk about html then HTML means 'what?'
          HTML -> what?
if we are sowing the website the 'what?'
portion in this will define by 'html' tag.
"  'HTML' main work is to label the things"

'CSS' means to make the styling/appearence
'Javascript' is our brain.

---------------------------------X--------------------------------------------------------
Now the Actual start of an HTML.

HTML -> language which define structure
Example : If we have a web-page and in this
         we define allot of content(image, text, video)
To label the content one by one to define 'who is what?'
This  job is done by 
                  'HTML' which provide structure and description
of your web page.
