Thread Safe Alternatives to "ArrayList" in Java especially focusing on
"CopyOnWriteArrayList" - in complete detail with easy to understand 
concept, real use - cases, and technical insight.

            THREAD SAFE ALTERNATIVES TO ARRAYLIST IN JAVA
Java provides several ways to make list based data structures safe for
multi threaded environments, where multiple threads read/write data
simultaneously.
Let's explore the 3 main thread safe alternatives to ArrayList:
       1. Vector (Legacy Thread Safe List)
   # What is It?
 *Vector is a synchronized version of "ArrayList".
 *All its methods are internally synchronized using synchronized keyword.
   Example:
    Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
    vector.add("One");
    vector.add("Two");

  #Drawbacks:
 *Synchronizes every operation, even reads -> causes performance issues.
 *Considered outdated for modern apps.
 *Replaced by more advanced options like "CopyOnWriteArrayList".

       2. Collections.synchronizedList()
