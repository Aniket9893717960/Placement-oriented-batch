Ok so Spring JDBC works. and the way we have done is we have used H2
as a database, which is a in-memory database. But what if you want to 
use same external database.
let's say you want to use MySql or PostgreS, how we do it? So, what happens
is when you talk about H2, because we also need the dataSource there.
Now for H2 since it is a embedded database,It knows where H2 is,

But when u talk about external DBMS it will not work So, let's see
So, in my machine i already have a MySql database. It doesn't matter
which DBMS u have, you just have to change something,
Some configuration to make it work.

So, whatever u comfortable with, so, let me open MySQL And for that 
I am using 'Workbench' because that's what we have data in H2, i went
to change it. So, i would say update i should done that when  i was 
replacing '69' to '71'.

I will setting the values but any way, i'll just file update query
