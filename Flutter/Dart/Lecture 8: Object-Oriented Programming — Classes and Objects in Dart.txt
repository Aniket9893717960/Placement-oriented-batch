            1.What is Object Oriented Programming?
Imagine designing a car. You don't build each car from scratch, instead,
u create a blueprint (class), then produce an many identical cars
(objects or instances) as u need. OOP lets u describe real world things
(like users, product, shapes) as code blueprints.

 i. Why Dart Supports OOP:
 Makes code easier to organize, reuse and expand.
