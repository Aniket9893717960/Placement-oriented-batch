Okay, so let's solve this problem of mapping. 
The thing is if u want to map this, you don't have to do any qualification
for the XML, luckily. we have to use annotation.

Now, which annotation we have to use? So for this, for mapping the request.
we have to use annotation call Request Mapping. And in this mapping u have
to pass the path.

The path here is 'homepage'. So, whenever someone calls the 'homepage',
this is something I want to execute. It is as simple as that. Just a 
request mapping, it will come to know that this is a mapping we have to do.

which is for the 'slash'. Yeah, if you're doing for the students, u can
also say 'student'. but at this point i want to map it for the '/'
'homepage'. And that's the only change u have to make.

let's refresh this taking some time, go back to your browser. And say,
refresh and done. Something happend:
"Okay, it's not the same thing which we were expecting.We are executing a
page. But u can see it says, Do you want to allow downloads on local
host?"

If u say allow something got downloaded. If i see here it says unknown 
file. I mean that's weird.
Atleast we are able to call this home. This is woeking right? So, we have
reached to this point. where we are able to call a particular method,
depend upon the mapping.

And request mapping is not the onlly method we have. So, apart from
'RequestMapping'. we also have 'GetMapping', 'PostMapping'.

We'll see that later. So, if i say, i'll show u just a method name,
like we got 'GetMapping', 'PostMapping', so we'll see that when to use
what. But At this point we're using 'RequestMapping'.

The reason it is not working is because by default,'springboard'
does not support JSP page. So, we have to basically convert. So, 
remember we talked about conversion, we have to convert your JSP
into Servlet?

Who will do that? And that's where u need a help here. So, we have
to add one more dependency to achieve that, which is called a 
"Tomcat Jasper".

So, i will go to my browser and go to your "MVN repository".
And search for "Tomcat Jasper".
CODE OF "MVNRepository"
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-jasper</artifactId>
        <version>10.1.39</version>
    </dependency>

Okay, let's import this particular package. Reload your Maven and 
that's done. We got this dependency and i hope this time it'll work.
Now if u go back to your browser now, go back to 'homepage' which is not
working,

let's do "localhost:8080" then enter and boom
