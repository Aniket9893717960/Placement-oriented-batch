Now let's work with 'OneToMany' So, what i want to do now is
As an 'Alien' we have 'Laptop' we got one here.
  When u say multiple we have to provide the 'list' of laptop.
And we also input the package of 'list'.
Now we will change this to 'laptops' not 'laptop'

                   import java.util.List;
                    @OneToOne
                  private List<Laptop> laptops;

Then we have to make changes in ' Getter's And Setter's '
And 'toString'as well
