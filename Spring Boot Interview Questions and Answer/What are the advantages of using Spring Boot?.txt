Spring Boot is a framework that creates stand alone,
production grade Spring based Applications. So, this frameowrk has so many
advantages.
Easy to use: The majority of the boilerplate code required to create a 
             Spring application is reduced by Spring boot.

Rapid Developement: Spring Boot's opinionated approach and auto
                    configuration enables developers to quickly
develop apps without the need for time - consuming setup,
cutting down on developement time.

Scalable: Spring Boot apps are intended to be scalable. This implies
          they may be simply scaled up or down to match your 
          application's needs.

Production-ready: Metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
                  are just a few of the features that Spring Boot includes
and are designed for use in production environments.
