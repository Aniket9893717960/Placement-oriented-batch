In this lec, we will explore important unique features of Dart, why they 
exist, and how Dart's design choices help solve common programming challenges.
We'll keep everything simple and fun!

1. Just In Time(JIT) And Ahead-Of-Time(AOT) Compilation: Why So much Speed?
i. What are JIT and AOT?
 *JIT(Just-In-Time) Compilation is like a magic cook who reads the recipe 
  and prepares the dish while guests are arriving. It allows u to test and 
  change code quickly.
 *AOT(Ahead Of Time) Compilation is like preparing all dishes before the 
  guests arrive, so food is ready immediately when served.

ii. Why Does Dart Use Both?
 *During development, Dart uses JIT so programmers can quiclky test
  and see changes without waiting a long time. This is called "hot reload".
 *For the final app users, Dart uses AOT to convert code into super fast 
  native machine code that runs lightning fast on phones or computers.

 Reason:
 This hybrid approach balances developer productivity (fast testing) and
 app performance (fast user experience), making Dart apps both easy to 
 build and fast to run.

2. Null Safety: The Shield Against Crashes
