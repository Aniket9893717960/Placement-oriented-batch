         Give me an overview about Your Project?
Url shortener a full stack web application to convert long URLs 
into short, shareable links while providing analytics on click -
through rates.
I have used some technologies in backend like:
Framework: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL (Stores users, URL mappings, and click events)
Authentication: JWT (Stateless, role-based access control)
APIs: RESTful endpoints for URL shortening,
       redirection and analytics.
   i. URL Shortening:
  Use Base62 encoding for compact, collision-resistant short codes.
  ii. Redirection:
  Handles high-volume redirects (HTTP 302) with minimal latency.
  iii. User Authentication:
  Secure registration/login using JWT tokens.
  Role-based access (e.g., ROLE_USER for basic features).
