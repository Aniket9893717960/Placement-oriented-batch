                        WHY TO USE SPRING?
Spring framework is a Java platform that is open source. ROD JOHNSON 
created it,
and it was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. 
When it comes to size and transparency, Spring is featherweight.

Spring framework's basic version is about 2MB in size. The Spring 
framework's 
core capabilities can be used to create any Java Program, however there 
are 
modifications for constructing web applications on top of the 
java EE platform. By offering a POJO- based programming model,
the spring framework aims to make J2EE easier to use and to promote
good programming habits.
