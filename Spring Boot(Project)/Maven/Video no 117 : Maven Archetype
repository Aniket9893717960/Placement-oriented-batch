So, we talk about here is 'Archetype' As i maintoined before
basically u can create your own templates and use some
existing templates.

Let's say if you want to build a Spring project or any framework 
project where u have to done allot of configuration by your 
self but what if you think 

'hey u know in this world there are so many developers they might have 
work on some framework so, what if i get those configuration by
default of course u will not get every thing in the world but there
are some templates which available in maven'

we use them or we create our own so, this type of templates are basically
called 'arctypes' Now how we gonna use it.

So, basically u were create your own archtype let's say i were create my new
project 
let's say if you click here on left hand side 'Manu' then we click on
'New Project' u say there is an option of 'Maven Archetype' so, 
basically u can use some 'Archtype' u give him
  i. Name let's say 'DemoSpringProj' then Nothing change at some 
         options.
  ii. then we see 'Archtype' to select what kind of project u were building
          There are multiple projects like
          'maven-archetype-j2ee-simple' to create 'j2ee' project
          'maven-archtype-quickstart' if you want to just simple configuration
                                      Nothing much
          'maven-archtype-webapp' If you want to build the web application 
                                  where u need whole those structure 


But this are not the only options we have the thing is if you see the 
    iii.'catlog' option here by default it's 'Internal' it's something
                 which is in the plugin itself or the 'maven' installation
                 itself.
What if u want the archtype form the internet.
