what is ECMA Script,ES6,ES13?
How javascript run into a machine or where it runs?
------------------------------------
                    Javascript
                   ------------
Javascript was Developed by  Branden Eich.
AT the starting time the first name before
javascript is Mocha(coffee name).
              ------------------
But second name after 'Mocha' If you predict
'Javascipt' than u are wrong 2nd name is
'LiveScript'
 ----------

Javascript is generally scripting language the idea
of building 'Javascript' is running Behaviour
like how to manipulate the content visibility,structure on
'Clint side' and Browser.

Javascript is a light weight programming language
throw which we try to create games or 
build CLI tools
If we talk about Adding Functionalities or
Providing anonymous Behaviour 
or Brain behind all this thing in a
web page All possible because of
Javascript.

                      How javascript works
                      --------------------
if we write the 'C++' program then what was our actual requirment
i. Translator: Compiler because to covert our C++ program into 
               machine understand able format.
                     While In javaScript
To run our javascript program to 'Browser' in between u have 
required a layer name 'JS Engine'(like Chorme has 'V8')
which parse our javascript code into machine readable 
format.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Node Js
      ---------
If Javascript will be merged with C++ program 
than used this as Backend/Server-side than it becomes 
Node Js.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           ECMAScript
           -----------
During the building for javaScript Developers will try to ensure that
Features we are Developing make the standards and consistency
so, that if the Javascript runs in Different operating systems
all the functionalities remind same.

WE requiered a set of rules, blue print, protocols that we have to 
follow it to add features/functionality in standard way.
This requirment is full filled with the help of
ECMAScript.
