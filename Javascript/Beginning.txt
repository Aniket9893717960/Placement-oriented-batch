what is ECMA Script,ES6,ES13?
How javascript run into a machine or where it runs?
------------------------------------
                    Javascript
                   ------------
Javascript was Developed by  Branden Eich.
AT the starting time the first name before
javascript is Mocha(coffee name).
              ------------------
But second name after 'Mocha' If you predict
'Javascipt' than u are wrong 2nd name is
'LiveScript'
 ----------

Javascript is generally scripting language the idea
of building 'Javascript' is running Behaviour
like how to manipulate the content visibility,structure on
'Clint side' and Browser.

Javascript is a light weight programming language
throw which we try to create games or 
build CLI tools
If we talk about Adding Functionalities or
Providing anonymous Behaviour 
or Brain behind all this thing in a
web page All possible because of
Javascript.

                      How javascript works
                      --------------------
if we write the 'C++' program then what was our actual requirment
i. Translator: Compiler because to covert our C++ program into 
               machine understand able format.
                     While In javaScript
To run our javascript program to 'Browser' in between u have 
required a layer name 'JS Engine'(like Chorme has 'V8')
which parse our javascript code into machine readable 
format.
We have more than one Js Engine like :
1 V8       2. SpiderMonkey(Developed by Modezila FireFox)
3. JavaScriptCore                4. Chakra

            Methods to run Javascript are :
            -------------------------------
1. Run on the browser             ---------------------------------------------------
2. run on code Editior like Vs code.                                                |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
       Node Js                                                                      |
      ---------                                                                     |
If Javascript will be merged with C++ program                                       |
than used this as Backend/Server-side than it becomes                               |
Node Js.                                                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
           ECMAScript                                                               |
           -----------                                                              |
During the building for javaScript Developers will try to ensure that               |
Features we are Developing make the standards and consistency                       |
so, that if the Javascript runs in Different operating systems                      |
all the functionalities remind same.                                                |

WE requiered a set of rules, blue print, protocols that we have to                  |
follow it to add features/functionality in standard way.                            |
This requirment is full filled with the help of                                     |
ECMAScript.                                                                         |
----------                                                                          |

                Now let's start programming               <---------------------------
               -----------------------------
if you have created a web page then 
click the 'Right' button from the mouse 
and click 'inspect'
then in frunt of you poped up various options
at which click on 'console' window.

                        Concole window
                        ---------------
with the help of console window we interact with the 
browser just like print something, log something and
etc.
                    Now come to our topic
                    ---------------------
For print anything we use 'console.log()' command.
it's means is 'on console we have to log something'.
Example :
       'console.log("My name is Babbar")'
this will print the same thing on console Screen.
Another Example :
        'console.log(2+3);'
print '5' as an answer.

                  2. run Javascript code Editior like Vs code.
                  --------------------------------------------
We use Internal Javascript to integreate the javascript code 
in (.html file) with the help of '<script>' tag which we can use
inner the '<body>' tag.

It's not necessary You will use '<script>' tag anywhere in 
'<html>' tag but for the best Practise we use '<script>' tag 
will be use at the End of '<body>' tag Because to make
sure that before 'javascript' code all the code should
render perfectly to make the code performace better.

                But just like at a time of learning CSS 
we make sure that we doesn't use 'Inline CSS' rather than
we build a seperate (.css file) import it throw our own
(.html) file to make Moduler/seperated code to avoid 
Code Complexity.
                   Seperate JS file
                  ------------------
For more Increasing Modulerity, Readability, Maintainability
We make a Seperate '.js' file to write the 'javascript'
code.

Now we try to link java-script code into the .html file.
in '<script>' tag in '<body>' tag we use attribute
name 'src' where we write location of (.js) file
