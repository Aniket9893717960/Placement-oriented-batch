So, our project is ready, i mean the structure is ready. Now let's create 
a servlet. Now if you think about creating something in java, So, lelt's
say if you want to create a feature, we create a class right?

So, here also if you want to create a servlet, u have to create a class.
So, what i will do is i will just go back to my project. I'll right click
here and say new.

let me create a simple class here and we'll name this class as, let's say
"HelloServlet". Of course you can name anything you want, but having a 
servlet at the send defines or it tells the developers that, 
"hey, this is a servlet, right?"
