                              TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF
Hello, my name is Aniket Rathore, and I am from Indore, the cleanest city in India for the past seven years.

I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Big Data Analytics in collaboration
with IBM from Shri Vaishnav Institute of Information Technology.

I completed my Higher Secondary Education from Shri RK Daga Maheshwari Academy with 61.8% and my Senior Secondary 

Education from Shri Vaishnav Academy with 60%. In JEE Mains, I secured 55.56 percentile.

I have a strong technical background in C, C++, Java, Full Stack Java Development, and DBMS. I also worked on 
an innovative project called 'Online Voting System,' a web-based Java application designed to modernize traditional voting methods. 
I led this project from start to finish, handling both technical development and project management.

I am a dedicated learner and problem solver who enjoys taking on challenges. 
My hobbies include playing chess and reading books, which help me improve my strategic thinking and analytical skills.

With my technical skills, project experience, and problem-solving approach, I am eager to contribute to your organization and grow as a professional.

Thank you!

                        WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU
You should consider hiring me because I bring a well-rounded combination 
of technical proficiency which I think most of the students done firstly. But I have actively 
participated in events like The model United Nations(MUN) at SVVV and IIT Indore
which have helped me develop confidence, public speaking skills and ability to present 
ideas clearly and persuasively.
Additionally, my internship experience and participation in coding challenges have
made me comfortable working under deadlines, both independently and as part of a team.
I believe my balanced skill set, along with a strong work ethic and 
eagerness to contribute meaningfully, makes me a valuable fit for
your organization.
