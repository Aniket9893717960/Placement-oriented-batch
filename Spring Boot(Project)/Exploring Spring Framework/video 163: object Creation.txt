When we will create the object of 'Alien'. Here we is "Spring" And "I".
Here we try to solve the question is 
"when exactly spring creating the object in spring container." So,
i am gessing there are two places.
i. it's happening at line no. 9
ii. it's happening at line no. 10

So, i want u to think about this And whenever u want to answering it
may be in the comments. where u comment something on this place.
On which line u were creating the object.

I hope u made answering up your answer let's understand this let's
find it. Just ask spring and 'Main.java' code
"when exactly u were creating the object."

To do that what i will do is i will go back to my 'Alien' class.
bacause that's where the magic is happening This is the class of which
u creating an object.

what i will do here is we creating an constructor because every time
u creating an object we call a constructor.
In 'Alien' we create an no - argument constructor.
  public Alien(){
    System.out.println("Object Create");
  }
