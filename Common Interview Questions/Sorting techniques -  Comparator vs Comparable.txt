   Real - Life Analogy
   ----   ---- -------
Imagine you're organizing a cricket tournament:
  By default, you're sorting players by their jersey number - this is like
  'Comparable'(default sorting logic).
  But now, someone asks you to sort by highest runs scored or alphabetically
  by name - this is like  'Comparator'(custom sorting logic).

 Comparable Interface (java.lang.Comparable)
 -------------------------------------------
Is used when you want to define the natural/default sorting order of your 
objects.You need to implement this interface in the class of the objects 
you're sorting.
Syntax
  public class Student implements Comparable<Student>{
      int id;
      String name;

      public int compareTo(Student other){
            return this.id - other.id; //ascending order by id
      }
  }
