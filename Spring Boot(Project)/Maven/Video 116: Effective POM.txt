At last video till this point we talk about
we have to discuss different stuff of course to configure your maven
u have to make changes in this file.

Now if you want to create a package u have to maintoin certain things right
For your own project if you want to make a 'jar' file u baiscally need.
       'groupId'   'artifactId'      'version'

That's how u can create a jar file or u can create your own libraries if you want
and then in your project if you want add dependenies then u can write it in the 'pom.xml' for 'Dependencies' tag.

what if you want to add some 'plugin's' of course u can add extra tag here
for the 'plugin' even that works
U can use the tag name 'pluginRepositories' u can maintoin those things

U can configure want u wanted to work but if u not maintoin the plugin but 
still u can able to done those things right.

    'Pom.xml' file will show u certain things right which u want to change.
But there are more setting to it which not even visible to u.

It will not the 'effect u pom' or 'super pam' which is the parent u can
say basically whatever u done changes here Is also reflected in the 'effective 
pam'.

So, let's say man want to work with your project they didn't look at the pam 
file but i know at this point u are ok but it look like an effective pam.
It will have other configuration as well as the configuration which u have done 
But how will u see that Different IDE's have different way of showing it.

In fact i should be working on maven using 'Netbeans IDE'
